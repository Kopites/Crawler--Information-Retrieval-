PowerShot SX270 Grey

PowerShot SX270 Grey
 Canon's powerful 20x Optical Zoom and 25mm Wide-Angle lens with Optical Image Stabilizer delivers stunning images from up close or at a distance.12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor combined with the new DIGIC 6 Image Processor creates the Canon HS SYSTEM for improved low-light performance up to ISO 6400 and enhanced image quality.Capture 1080p/60p Full HD video for high-quality capture of moving subjects.Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper camera settings based on 58 predefined shooting situations and Face ID function adjusts focus and exposure priority based on pre-registered faces.New Hybrid Auto utilizes a combination of Smart AUTO and Intelligent IS to create a beautiful and steady 720p HD video clip (up to approximately 4 seconds) in Movie Digest mode every time you shoot a still image.Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition.Additional Features.Capture The World as You See It.Powerful 20x Optical Zoom with 25mm Wide-Angle Lens The PowerShot SX270 HS features a powerful 20x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. The camera's lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics with advantages that go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25–500mm (35mm equivalent), the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes, with details you've never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization.Optical Image StabilizerHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers. Beautiful Images and Fast Performance Start Here.12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor The PowerShot SX270 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.Canon DIGIC 6 Image ProcessorThe PowerShot SX270 HS is equipped with Canon's very latest proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor makes several important advancements, including improved sensitivity that allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions. Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. In addition, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables video recording in MP4 format. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.Canon HS SYSTEM for exceptional low-light performance up to ISO 6400The PowerShot SX270 HS gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's latest-generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and videos. Full HD Video That's Better Than Ever.1080p/60p Full HD videoWith the camera's advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling MP4 format recording, the PowerShot SX270 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution. A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos.Smart AUTO Smart AUTO for the PowerShot SX270 HS has been significantly expanded, making it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images – and videos – you're looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as "keeper" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX270 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.Face IDFace ID on the PowerShot SX270 HS gives you an easy way to improve every shot of the people you love. Simply take a picture of up to 12 faces you would like the camera to register, then enter names and ages. Once a person is registered, the camera will pick him or her out of a group (even against a busy background) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face, even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children, focus on your baby when pictured with an adult, and capture the best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked, with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because you'll identify each face you register, Face ID makes it easy to search images by name. Remember the Day in Crisp HD.New Hybrid Auto utilizes a combination of Smart AUTO and Intelligent IS to create a beautiful and steady 720p HD video clip in Movie Digest mode every time you shoot a still image New Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX270 HS brings enhanced image quality to the popular Movie Digest feature on PowerShot digital cameras. Movie Digest records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, any time you're shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this "highlight reel" is more beautiful than ever. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady. Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation.Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition It's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX270 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. Additional Features.ECO Mode The PowerShot SX270 HS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.

The EOS Rebel T3i freely enables easy angle adjustments even if the camera is mounted on a tripod or has a battery grip attached. Note: Model used is not EOS Rebel T3i and is used to illustrate vari-angle feature only.With 1,040,000 (dots/VGA) pixels for spectacular detail, the advanced, smudge-resistant monitor includes high transparency materials plus anti-reflective and water-repellant coatings to provide clear and bright viewing. Superb for reviewing, editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View function, the Vari-angle Clear View LCD monitor is also the perfect means for accessing camera settings like ISO, metering modes, AF Point selection, the horizontal Electronic Level and flash options. Automatic Scene Analysis for Standout Color.The EOS Rebel T3i DSLR's new Scene Intelligent Auto mode unites five Canon digital camera technologies – the new Picture Style Auto, plus Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure –into a powerful new feature for photographers. Using the advanced EOS Scene Detection System, the camera automatically analyzes the image, taking into account faces, colors, brightness, movement and contrast. Scene Intelligent Auto then chooses the enhancing features to deliver maximum impact. Blues and greens are more vivid, “hot” colors are more fiery, and skin tones are smooth and truer to life. Make Your Images As You See Them.Basic+ is a new creative imaging feature that makes it easy to create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options: Shoot by ambience selectionBased on the Picture Style and its parameters (sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone), the exposure compensation and white balance correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also can also select the strength of the ambience effect.Shoot by lighting or scene typeAlthough the actual parameter set is the white balance, the settings are expressed in more understandable terms.The Multi-Aspect Function of the EOS Rebel T3i lets you express an image in one of three ways by matching the aspect ratio to each scene. In addition to the camera’s standard 3:2 ration, the Multi-Aspect Function includes a 1:1 ratio that creates the sensation that the viewer's gaze is focusing upon the center of the image. At the 4:3 ratio, you get nearly the same aspect ratio as a regular TV or a 4:3 computer display. The 16:9 aspect ratio provides a wide look, much the same as HDTV.The EOS Rebel T3i incorporates five in-camera Creative Filters so you can artistically manipulate scenes without the aid of an outside computer. Soft Focus lends a dreamy, romantic aspect, while Grainy Black and White gives a dramatically gritty, hard-bitten look. Miniature Effect creates an illusion in which expansive subjects are seemingly reduced to doll-house-like proportions, and Toy Camera Effect recreates the colors and softness rendered by cameras with a plastic lens, an effect often sought after by art photographers. Fish Eye Effect mimics the “Fisheye” lenses that are favorites of professional photographers for their quirky, convex perspective. Intelligent Scene Analysis for Superb Exposure.The EOS Rebel T3i features a sophisticated, 63-zone Dual-layer sensor designed to complement the 9-point AF system. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding chosen AF points, this system delivers an advanced level of accuracy for better results even in difficult lighting situations. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T3i gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as in a theater or concert hall. This makes the EOS Rebel T3i ideal for scenes with extreme difference in brightness such as brightly lit scenes or backlit scenes; the camera balances exposure of the main subject at the background, and exposures are not overly influenced by bright areas in the shot. Since the EOS Rebel T3i provides high-speed X-sync (“X-sync” means the fastest shutter speed that can synchronize with a flash burst at the moment the shutter is fully released) up to 1/200 sec., the range of photographic expression is dramatically increased, allowing the EOS Rebel T3i to be used with confidence in bright scenes or dim. 63-zone Metering SystemNever Miss a Moment.The EOS Rebel T3i can shoot up to 3.7 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 6 consecutive RAW files or approximately 34 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel T3i can capture even rapidly-unfolding scenes with ease. Photography Made Truly Easy.The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR demystifies great photography by including an in-camera Feature Guide. Appearing on the camera's LCD, the Feature Guide displays a simple description or advice for the respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during Mode Dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions (during normal shooting, Live View shooting, movie shooting, and playback). The Feature Guide appears automatically during Mode Dial operations and when a function is selected on the Quick Control screen. Flexible Storage with Memory Cards.The EOS Rebel T3i uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T3i DSLR's compact and lightweight body design.Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with Eye-Fi* SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel EOS Rebel T3i can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada; please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.The Best Optics for the Best Images.EF LensesThe EOS Rebel T3i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like the Canon Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses helps to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light. With a dizzying array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel T3i with superlative Canon optics. Flash PhotographyWith a flash sync speed of 1/200 of a second, the EOS Rebel T3i also features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering — giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to “Average” flash metering — where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. Additionally, the EOS Rebel T3i has a Speedlite transmitter built-in for convenient, full-featured wireless control of EX-series Speedlite flashes set as slave units.The Canon Speedlite 430EX II is the ideal step-up accessory for powerful flash shooting with the EOS Rebel T3i. It has excellent flash power (maximum guide number of 141 ft./43m at ISO 100), and is the perfect way to get great flash pictures when you can't get right up to the subject. The 430EX II is also great for bounce flash, with its tilting and swiveling flash head.  It automatically zooms the flash head to cover lenses ranging from 16mm up to 105mm or longer with the EOS Rebel T3i. Of course, it works with the camera to provide full E-TTL II automatic flash exposure. And the 430EX II has a powerful AF-assist beam, which allows the camera to autofocus even in total darkness on subjects as far as 32 ft. from the camera.

It gives you a great range of potential images from a single location, which is perfect for sporting events and other occasions when your shooting stance is fixed, or times when moving in too close might disrupt the action you're trying to capture.

The PowerShot A2600 gives you Smart AUTO — sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images.

For landscapes, cityscapes and other still scenes, the camera takes 3 quick successive shots and composes them into a single clear image. If the subject is moving, the camera takes 3 successive shots, then automatically saves the clearest image.A Charge that Lasts as Long as a MemoryNew ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life.The PowerShot A2600 takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management.

Company Profile
Walmart Canada was established in 1994 with the acquisition of the Woolco chain. Over the past 18 years, Walmart Canada has more than doubled the number of stores in Canada and more than tripled the number of associates, creating a strong, stable retail chain which offers career opportunities. 
With headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, Walmart Canada now operates a growing network of more than 370 stores, including traditional discount stores, supercentres and an environmental demonstration store in Burlington, Ontario. With nearly 90,000 associates the company is one of Canada's largest employers. Walmart Canada's corporate culture was recently ranked among the 10 most admired corporate cultures in Canada by Waterstone Human Capital Inc.
Walmart is committed to saving Canadians money so they can live better. Each of our stores carries close to 100,000 different products ranging from apparel and home decor to electronics and grocery, plus specialty services such as pharmacies, garden centres, and vision centres.

The E-PM2 features a vertical bar touch navigation menu. The E-PM2 is designed to optimize the touch screen LCD and was introduced to operate the MENU display with a new simple operation instead of a mode dial.

Description & Features+


The Olympus PEN series provides superior optics, interchangeable lenses and multimedia capabilities - combining the creative freedom of a sophisticated digital SLR with the simple controls and portability of a point-and-shoot. Everything is fast on the Olympus PEN E-PL5 digital camera. The PEN E-PL5 is perfect. Shoot images with stunning detail and vivid color thanks to a powerful tandem of a sizeable 16 MP Live MOS Sensor and our TruePic VI image processing engine. Olympus’ Dust Reduction System assures spot-free images, even if you change lenses. Every time you turn on the camera, the patented Supersonic Wave Filter silently vibrates, flinging and collecting dust so that it doesn’t interfere with the picture imaging at any time. Wi-Fi capability lets you transfer photos wirelessly to smartphones and tablets with the FlashAir memory card and the OLYMPUS Image Share application. Shoot up to 29 minutes of 1080 60i HD video and stereo sound in either .MOV or .AVI formats. A Direct HD Movie Button switches you from still to movie mode with just the press of a button.
•   Removable Grip    • Olympus Image Share Technology    • Small Target AF    • Image Rotation in Playback    • Downloadable Background Music Selection    • Customizable Self Timer    • 23 Scene Modes    • HDMI Output    • AF Tracking    • Wireless Flash Compatible    • Multiple Exposure Shooting    • 7 Picture Modes

Description & Features+


The Olympus PEN series provides superior optics, interchangeable lenses and multimedia capabilities - combining the creative freedom of a sophisticated digital SLR with the simple controls and portability of a point-and-shoot. Everything is fast on the Olympus PEN E-PL5 digital camera. The PEN E-PL5 is perfect. Shoot images with stunning detail and vivid color thanks to a powerful tandem of a sizeable 16 MP Live MOS Sensor and our TruePic VI image processing engine. Olympus’ Dust Reduction System assures spot-free images, even if you change lenses. Every time you turn on the camera, the patented Supersonic Wave Filter silently vibrates, flinging and collecting dust so that it doesn’t interfere with the picture imaging at any time. Wi-Fi capability lets you transfer photos wirelessly to smartphones and tablets with the FlashAir memory card and the OLYMPUS Image Share application. Shoot up to 29 minutes of 1080 60i HD video and stereo sound in either .MOV or .AVI formats. A Direct HD Movie Button switches you from still to movie mode with just the press of a button.

CEO Says NVIDIA Will Focus On Mobile, Parallel Processing

          Nvidia's stock has soared after the company's Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang outlines a strong fiscal outlook for next year.         

          REUTERS         




NVIDIA's chief executive officer, Jen-Hsun Huang, said the company will focus on making its signature graphics processors more energy efficient with parallel architectures, with its innovation targeting the mobile computing sector. 


Speaking before a group of analysts at the company's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters, he said mobile devices will eventually replace personal computers for many functions. The mobile device will become our most personal computing device, he said.
The growth of mobile devices, which have strict constraints on battery size and weight, is one reason NVIDIA is focusing on parallel computing architecture. It is more energy efficient, and thus offers more computing power without the need for better cooling systems and larger batteries.
One of the big drivers for mobile devices is the Internet, Huang said, because in order to make use of the immediate availability of content, the phone or tablet has to have a fully functioning browser, and that requires a fully functional computer.
Huang praised Apple for understanding that, and creating the iPhone. The iPhone is a mobile phone, but one that benefits from the Internet in a way previous devices did not. With fresh eyes a computer company could see that, he said. Apple's roll out of the iPhone was coupled with the invention of the Android OS, which grew faster than any OS before it.
Demonstrating a Motorola Atrix, Huang noted that it can do many of the things previously reserved for PCs. I have never made a phone call on it, he said. I am more likely to fire off an email or text.
Most desktops and laptops are built with Intel chips at their core, based on the x86 architecture. Huang said that the new ARM-based designs will pose no problems for people who buy PCs or mobile devices in the next few years, as Microsoft is already working on an ARM-native version of Office and NVIDIA is working with Adobe to create a version of Flash that will work well with the new processors. Microsoft has already announced that it is building a version of Windows optimized for ARM-based chips.
NVIDIA's recently released Tegra processor is an ARM-based design, and it is the brain for a number of mobile devices including the Atrix and Xoom tablet, both from Motorola. NVIDIA is also providing the graphics engine for the new MacBook Air.
Huang said the future progress in parallel processing will eventually result in enough power to make computers even thinner than a MacBook Air. If you build on a low-power processor, we can make something thin and exquisite, better than the MacBook Air, and [Apple] has done a great job on that product.
We need the processor to get better and better, he said.

						02/13/2010 04:00:00 PM PSTsecondary dateAfter complaining for months that Intel had unfairly hindered sales of its chipsets, Nvidia won a huge ally when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in December slapped Intel with an antitrust lawsuit that made similar allegations.The controversy was no small matter to Santa Clara-based Nvidia. Sales of chipsets, which link microprocessors with various computerized components, amounted to about $672 million — or nearly 29 percent of its revenue — during the first nine months of 2009.If it wins its battle with Intel, which vehemently denies wrongdoing, Nvidia believes it could see a big increase in those sales. But many analysts say that chipsets are becoming technological dinosaurs.Incorporated in 1993, Nvidia for years had coexisted in relative peace with its gargantuan Santa Clara neighbor, Intel, which has 10 times the annual revenue, because both companies' semiconductors were essential to personal computers. Nvidia's highly praised graphics chips — known as graphics processing units, or GPUs — provided stunning visual effects for video games and other applications, while Intel's microprocessors — also called central processing units, or CPUs — served as the PC's brains.In 2004, Intel even entered into a licensing deal with Nvidia, in which it obtained some of Nvidia's graphics know-how in exchange for letting Nvidia chipsets, which incorporate GPUs, connect with Intel's central processing units.AdvertisementBut the companies' relationship soured last year when Intel sued Nvidia, claiming their pact didn't allow Nvidia's chipsets to link with Intel's latest CPUs. Intel said it took the position because its new microprocessors have taken over a key chipset function. But Nvidia cried foul and countersued.With the dispute headed for trial later this year, the FTC sued Intel in December, accusing it, among other things, of engaging in an underhanded campaign to derail Nvidia's chipset sales. Although other regulatory bodies in the U.S, Europe and Asia also have accused Intel of antitrust violations, the FTC was the first to raise the chipset issue. The federal agency claimed Intel feared Nvidia because the CPU market that Intel dominates faces increasing competition from GPUs, which not only can perform many tasks done by CPUs but process data much quicker. Moreover, the federal agency noted, even though Intel is a big producer of graphics chips, its versions are widely considered inferior.In some cases when Intel packaged its graphics chips with its chipsets, according to the FTC, computer makers replaced Intel's products with Nvidia's chipsets. To discourage that practice, the FTC claimed, Intel improperly sold its packaged chips at "below-cost," while charging manufacturers using Nvidia's chipsets "significantly higher prices."In Intel's recent formal response to the FTC's lawsuit, expected to be tried in September, the company strenuously maintained that its marketing practices are legal. It also accused the FTC of misunderstanding the chip industry and overlooking the fact that graphics chipsets "will not continue to be used widely in new computer platforms," because graphics functions increasingly are being built directly into CPUs to boost performance and save energy. Many analysts make the same point about chipsets. They note that combo chips containing CPUs and GPUs not only are on the drawing boards at Intel and Sunnyvale-based Advanced Micro Devices, but already are being sold by Nvidia, which traditionally had shunned the CPU market. In 2008, Nvidia introduced Tegra, a combo chip it promotes for use in everything from cars and portable media players to smartbooks and tablets.Tegra and Nvidia's stand-alone GPUs are widely expected to keep the company financially healthy for years, even if its chipset business goes away. But Nvidia believes it may continue profiting from chipsets, too.Because Nvidia's chipsets typically offer superior graphics, manufacturers in the future still may want to incorporate them into computers containing an Intel combo chip, said Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez. Consequently, as long as Nvidia's products aren't barred from being linked with Intel's, "our chipset business could significantly increase," he said.Contact Steve Johnson at sjohnson@mercurynews.com or 408-920-5043.Print

GRID GPUs
NVIDIA's Kepler™-based GRID K1 and K2 boards are specifically  designed to enable rich graphics in virtualized environments.

GPU Virtualization¹ 
GRID boards feature the NVIDIA Kepler architecture that, for the first time, allows hardware virtualization of the GPU. This means multiple users can share a single GPU, improving user density while providing true PC performance and compatibility.

Low-Latency Remote Display
NVIDIA's patented low-latency remote display technology greatly improves the user experience by reducing the lag that users feel when interacting with their virtual machine. With this technology, the virtual desktop screen is pushed directly to the remoting protocol.

H.264 Encoding²
The Kepler GPU includes a high-performance H.264 encoding engine capable of encoding simultaneous streams with superior quality. This provides a giant leap forward in cloud server efficiency by offloading the CPU from encoding functions and allowing the encode function to scale with the number of GPUs in a server.

Maximum User Density
NVIDIA GRID boards have an optimized multi-GPU design that helps to maximize user density. GRID K1 boards, which include four Kepler-based GPUs and 16GB of memory, are designed to host the maximum number of concurrent users. GRID K2 boards, which include two higher end Kepler GPUs and 8GB of memory, deliver maximum density for users of graphics-intensive applications.

Power Efficiency
GRID GPUs are designed to provide data center-class power efficiency, including the revolutionary new streaming multiprocessor, called "SMX". The result is an innovative, proven solution that delivers revolutionary performance per-watt for the enterprise data center.

24/7 Reliability 
GRID boards are designed, built, and tested by NVIDIA for 24/7 operation. Working closely with leading server vendors such as Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, and SuperMicro ensures GRID cards perform optimally and reliably for the life of the system.

Widest Range of Virtualization Solutions
GRID boards enable GPU-capable virtualization solutions from Citrix, Microsoft, and VMware, delivering the flexibility to choose from a wide range of proven solutions.

 <iframe width="520" height="293" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HxuVZbnBLuI?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>



See the difference between a single user per GPU and vGPU that allows multiple users.
For the first time, multiple virtual machines can directly access the graphics processing power of a single GPU.  Demand for desktop virtualization has grown as employees increasingly use their own notebooks and portable devices for work. But the user experience until now had been constrained by the subpar performance and limited compatibility of software-emulated graphics.  Now, the combination of Citrix XenDesktop and NVIDIA GRID™ vGPU allows businesses to broaden the reach of virtual desktop environments by efficiently sharing GPUs across the complete spectrum of users – from designers and engineers, to power users, to knowledge workers.1
For more information, visit the NVIDIA GRID Shared Virtual GPU (vGPU) Technology page

What is XenDesktop?
“Citrix XenDesktop is a desktop virtualization solution that transforms desktops and applications into a secure on-demand service available to any user, anywhere, on any device. With XenDesktop, you can deliver individual Windows, web and SaaS applications, or full virtual desktops, to PCs, Macs, tablets, smartphones, laptops, and thin clients with a high-definition user experience.“

Tech wrap: Can Nook tablet take on Kindle Fire?

Will “Made in America” sell in China?







SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp, rushing to stake out more territory in tablets and smartphones, said its new Tegra 3 processor delivers up to three times the graphics performance of its predecessor and uses 61 percent less power.
Previously code-named "Project Kal-El", the new quad-core chip is in production and is Nvidia's latest bet to expand into the fast-growing mobile market as tablets like Apple Inc's iPad eat into sales of personal computers.Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia, which started out making graphics chips for PCs and still makes most of its revenue that way, expects devices using the new processors to be on sale by the end of the year, Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told analysts on a conference call in September.Early in 2011, Nvidia's Tegra 2 mobile chip, which is based on architecture licensed from Britain's ARM Holdings, was included in several new gadgets from Samsung Electronics, Asustek Computer Inc and LG Electronics, raising Nvidia's profile with investors as well as its stock price.The first tablet to use the Tegra 3 chip will be Asustek's Eee Pad Transformer Prime, Nvidia said in a statement.ARM's power-sipping chip architecture is widely favored for mobile devices that depend on batteries and is also used by Qualcomm Inc and Texas Instruments Inc.Intel Corp so far has failed to find a foot hold in the mobile market and is hurrying to adapt its chip architecture, originally designed to make powerful PCs, to work efficiently in smartphones and tablets.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang)

Aiming to Power Ever More Complex Graphics, Nvidia Plans Quad-Core Mobile Chip This Year
/.article-title

Chipmaker Nvidia plans this year to introduce a four-core processor, code-named Project Kal-El, that should offer roughly five times the processing power of its existing Tegra chip and, what it says, has significantly more horsepower than an Intel Core 2 Duo chip.

Briefing reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Nvidia said it plans to include a 12-core graphics processor along with the quad-core CPU. All that processing oomph should support “Extreme HD” graphics with a resolution of up to 2,560 by 1,600 pixels. The chip is now sampling to customers, Nvidia said. 
The company has more ambitious goals for subsequent years, with  plans to more than double performance in each of the next three years with chips code-named Wayne, Logan and Stark.
Nvidia’s current Tegra 2 chip is at the heart of many Android phones and a number of Android Honeycomb tablets, including the Motorola Xoom, LG G-Slate and the just-introduced Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.
However, Nvidia isn’t the only company ramping things up. Qualcomm announced a new series of ARM-based chips on Monday, though its quad-core chip isn’t slated to arrive until 2012.
For more on Nvidia’s plans for the future, check out the onstage interview I did with CEO Jen-Hsun Huang at our D@CES event in January.

Summary:
Nvidia is demonstrating a quad-core mobile device chip at the Mobile World Congress, and by one benchmarking standard, the new chip is faster than Intel’s 2-GHz Core2Duo computer processor. As impressive as the new Tegra 2 is, devices with Tegra 3 could arrive this year.







Nvidia is currently demonstrating a quad-core mobile device chip at the Mobile World Congress (MWC), and by one benchmarking standard, the new chip is faster than an Intel 2-GHz Core2Duo computer processor. Currently dubbed Kal-El, the chip will likely be known as the Tegra 3 processor when it begins shipping to device manufacturers in August of this year, which is ahead of competing chips from Qualcomm and others. Regardless of which mobile chip designer wins the race to offer a mobile chip with four application processors, this news is another blow to Intel, which just lost a fair amount of software support from Nokia’s decision to partner with Microsoft.
While such a benchmark test is only one artificial indicator of chip performance — device speed is also influenced by memory, operating system and other factors — this news from Nvidia has to rile Intel. The company sold off its Xscale mobile chip division just prior to the smartphone revolution, which is now looking like a strategic mis-step. And in fairness to Intel, the new Nvidia chip is being compared to an Intel processor that launched in 2006; Intel has made positive strides to optimize its silicon for mobile devices since then but is still shut out of the mobile handset space. Even when you remove company names from the scenario, the benchmark test illustrates just how powerful mobile processors are becoming when they can offer performance similar to that of a laptop from just a handful of years ago.
Indeed, that theme sets the stage for mobile devices with even greater capabilities than what’s being shown at the current MWC event. Earlier this week, my colleague Stacey noted what advances we can expect from multi-core processors in mobiles: greater processing prowess for apps, yes, but also support for more cameras, both high-definition and 3-D, and improved gesture interfaces. More cores also helps speed up browsing, as Nvidia demonstrates in this video by enabling all four cores in Kal-El on an Android reference device:

Even as the current Tegra 2 impresses and is powering numerous new smartphones and tablets, Nvidia is packing their next new chip with 12 graphics cores. The company’s roadmap suggests new chips annually, with up to a 75x boost in performance over the current Tegra 2 by 2014. Indeed, the new Kal-El chip demonstrated 1440p video playback on a 2560×1600 resolution display, continuing my thought that mobile devices will slowly become the home set-top box for video entertainment and possibly even for gaming.

This is why Intel has no chance of entering the mobile/tablet markets. By the time they manage to optimize a watered down Atom chip for energy efficiency, Nvidia and other ARM chip makers will surpass it in performance. So now they actually have to get worried about making their i3-i7 line-up as efficient as ARM chips, because you can bet Nvidia is going after them with Tegra 4 in 2012 and Tegra 5 in 2013, especially once Windows for ARM is ready and will start shipping in laptops with ARM chips.
Tegra 3 should already be enough for most people as far as performance goes. After all, the Core 2 Duo is the chip inside MacBook Air, right?
Intel made the same fatal mistake that Nokia did. They didn’t realize, or refused to believe that ARM (or iPhone/Android in Nvidia’s case) are disruptive innovations, which basically means there’s no way you can fight against it with your old technology, just by improving on it. 
Intel’s only chance to remain relevant in the next decade is to start making ARM chips, which of course, is something they don’t want to hear, because that would mean huge conflict of interest for them.
Their StrongARM division failed because of the incompatible business model of ARM chips with their cost structure. Intel was used to making a lot of money on their chips, while ARM chips had to be sold for a lot less. Even Atom is not exactly the type of chip they love because it doesn’t bring them that much money, and it’s why they haven’t improved it much for the past few years. They just didn’t want to make it powerful enough to be used in laptops. They make a lot more on their i3 low-end chips for laptops. It helped that they also locked in the netbook market, so they didn’t have anyone to compete with.
So for them it seems “easier” to try to improve their x86 chips, even though in the end they have no chance of succeeding, just like Symbian never had a chance against iOS and Android, and it proved that they just wated 4 years for nothing. The same will happen with Intel. Two or three years from, we’ll look back and see how much time Intel wasted trying to improve Atom to compete with ARM chips.
I say it’s a good thing Intel will no longer be relevant in the next decade, because it looks like the mobile chip market is doing fine without them, and competition in the ARM market is strong because of the ARM licensing model. Chips seem to be doubling or tripling in power every 12 months, which is almost twice as fast as in the PC market. I think this is happening because of higher competition, but also because the industry doesn’t have to relearn making chips that powerful. They mostly need to use old technology but in a smaller package in and a more efficient way. 
I remember 2 years ago I was thinking the phone is as powerful as a PC 10 years ago, last year I thought it’s as powerful as a PC 7 years ago, and now with Tegra 3 they will get as powerful as a PC 5 years ago. The gap is closing fast on Intel.

Very well put. Intel has completely missed the boat on Smartphones. It’s a classic dilemma faced by many established companies (read Microsoft) 0 do you continue on the path that made you successful for many years or take a risk in moving to newer path. 
Intel still may have a chance to succeed – not on its own; but buying into this market. What do you think about them buying Nvidia. It not only gives them entry into ARM based chips; but also nice graphics functionality – two areas that will see more and more action in the coming years.

you do realize that we speak about a 5 year difference here, right?
the tegra chip you are speaking about which nvidia “claims” is faster then a chip produced 4 years ago = 5 years difference….

Core 2 Duo T7200 is produced 3 (yes.. three) years ago, has 34 TDP envelope while Tegra 3 will have at max 4 watts TDP for tablet/smartbook systems and a much lower TDP for smartphones.

From my post: “And in fairness to Intel, the new Nvidia chip is being compared to an Intel processor that launched in 2006.”
So, yes, I do realize we’re speaking about a 5 year difference. ;)
I’ve also been following Intel’s progress to pare down the power requirements of its chip, which it’s actively been doing since the first Atom in 2008 but still has the underlying chip in zero shipping phones. The vast majority of smartphones (which now outsell PCs, mind you) use ARM architecture, not Intel’s x86 architecture. In other words: there’s far more data to consider than Intel’s marketing pitch at MWC.

Kevin,
thanks for your fast reply. Indeed you did point it out and I also had read it.
I needed to mention it though as 5 years is like an eternity in mobile technology.
What phone did you use 5 years ago?
What I am looking forward to is the possibility to access the same content seamlessly on my tablet, my PC, my Smart Phone, my TV and my Car. Still a while to go but since we quoted 5 years above – I don’t think we will have to wait that long :)
ARM.L had 500.000.000 USD of annual revenue (last available financial report) while Intel spent 6 Billion on R&D. I truly believe Intel will catch up :) and will be a viable competitor.

Five years ago, I let my blog readers choose my phone for me and at the time, they picked the XV6700 on Verizon Wireless. Ironically, that ran a on 416 MHz Intel PXA 270 XScale processor! ;) No argument that 5 years is several mobile cycles, but the ARM chips from 5 years ago weren’t even close to competing with x86 chips – now they are as the gap continues to shrink at a faster rate.

This five year difference is wrt to performance of the ship and one should not confuse it with physical years. As someone pointed out earlier, just a couple of years ago (around iphone 1), the mobile processors were comparable to the desktop processors of the late 90′s. But in a couple of years, that has already shrunk to 5 years. In another couple of years, if nvidia keeps its promise (100x tegra 2 or 20x tegra 3 or ~20x core2duo), Intel should be really worried. 
I would love to have a laptop as light as my macbook air that is only 20 times more powerful.

The most impressive thing about NVIDIA’s ARM chips are their ability to handle graphic. I’m using the 2GHZ Intel chip they tested against in my laptop and no way can it handle full 1080p. So, while Intel’s chip is older NVIDIA is making a great GPU/CPU combination that will give the user a better overall experience.
12 GPU cores in this thing!

From what I’ve seen these chips are also OpenCL 1.1 compatible.  Does that mean they could compile OSX to run on them?  I don’t know much about different hardware architectures.  It would be an interesting CPU option for the Macbook Air :)  (I guess Apple will make their own.  But…)

BTW, anybody can claim any performance number on stupid benchmark. I am sad that articles like this doesn’t spend enough lines on explaining how valid the benchmark is, before explaining the “Scores”. Nvidia always over promises and under-delivers. This is probably the same. Why didn’t nvidia show Spec scores?

Agreed that benchmarks aren’t the “end-all, be-all” of performance claims – I noted in the post that there are many other factors involved. I consider benchmarks to be a high-level indicator of what to expect, but real-world usage is ultimately what matters. As far as the validity of the benchmark, it was created by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium and is considered by some to be a standard tool to compare core performances of chips.

Have you looked into the fact that the so called Coremark benchmark from the said consortium is so great that, anybody can post any scores on any platforms? You can make up Coremark scores! Let me say it right, “You can simulate the benchmark test in your head and come up with the score and post it on the Coremark website!”. Based on my mood today, I can make tegra a shitty platform today or put it on par with Supercomputers and post the scores on Coremark website! No authentification needed! Have fun!

I’d imagine any benchmark test can be simulated and faked, although as a public company, Nvidia has an obligation to its shareholders that certainly should help prevent that. Regardless, instead of focusing on the benchmarks — which I’ve already said are one of many performance indicators — why not turn the conversation into something constructive with opinions on the actual demonstration results shown in the video or the ability for the reference design to pipe 1440p to an external monitor and integrated display at the same time?

Intel stayed ahead in the semiconductor market because Andy Grove always paid attention to market trends before they were apparent to the rest of the chip makers.  Under his leadership, the company made numerous bold moves that were seen as high risk yet resulted in major steps forward.
Since Grove left, Intel has been led by people who don’t have the vision or insight that Grove always provided.  The bland leadership has made Intel just another semiconductor company that will bounce around in the market looking for a place to recoup its huge investment in advanced manufacturing.
It is this change in the company dynamic that has resulted in a complete fail on the mobile market and will continue to dog it until there is new leadership.  That’s not to say that any of the other processor manufacturers have the kind of visionary leadership that is necessary to be more than a commodity manufacturer – different companies will look strong at different times with nobody sitting on top.

Kevin,
Intel has to addaress 3 problems to address.
1) PRoblem #1: The smartphones and tablets value communication and media, processor is an afterthought. That puts value to QCOM who is innovating on the ‘connector’ and Nvidia who is innovating on the ‘media’.
2) Problem #2: Leadership. Paul would retire anyday. Sean got into a medical problem. Rest of the leadership is not strong to take Intel to the next level. Moreover. Intel has always grown leadership form within and that style is no longer viable in the new era. Need aggressive, fast turn around SoC with innovatin on both hardware and software.
3) Problem #3: Smartphones and tablets are eco-system plays. Not just Processor, or operating system. Like what happened to Alpha (2X over others), with SPARC (2X over other for throughput), the architectural wind has moved to eco-system and Intel is not just on the wrong side of architecture,  but on the platform and eco-system.
How to address all 3 of them?
Buy Nvidia
1) Buying Nvidia addresses the Hardware (ARM/SOC, media processing).
2) Buying Nvidia addresses leadership. The culture of Nvidia bring the right CEO (Jensun Huang – hard knocking driven given) and a culture of aggressively beating out competition. Nvidia came from #27 in graphics to #1. That is its culture. Intel’s culture is win around its defensible turf (x86 and process). Intel needs an outsider CEO.  The inside leadership don’t cut it
3)  Anand Chandrasekhar despite having had success with Centrino, failed on a number of things with Atom, Smartphones, tablets. Bet on Mobilin, on Meego. Too much NIH.  Intel has all the assets with Nvidia acquisition including leadership and everything non-apple (Windows eco-system and Android). They can take a pole position in tablet outside of iPAD and work their way. 
The ARM vs x86 is a pointless arguement. In my mind its a religious argument. There is no hard evidence to say that ARM is anything greater than 1.25X over any x86 w.r.t power/performance. Intel has lost the marketing war on this war.  ANycase, its no longer the ISA wars. Its media, connectors and eco-system. If you don’t have it, you loose. QCOM lacks the media and both Intel and QCOM are even keel on eco-system.
An Nvidia acquisition will make this a 2 horse race with QCOM. Otherwise expect QCOM to overtake INTC market cap within 18 months. Time is now. I am sure Jensen will take the offer if he is the CEO and that is the right thing for both companies.  It also bolsters Intel’s Server/HPC/graphics. Its no longer an FTC issue. (AMD has ATI)

NVIDIA expands on Project Kal-El, adds a fifth core


Chris Burns, Sep 20th 2011		Discuss [6]

Those interested in the processing power of mobile devices running any and all operating systems should be aware of NVIDIA’s Project Kal-El, a quad core CPU the group is prepping for a late 2011 released. We first learned about this project (and future projects with similar code-names) back at Mobile World Congress 2011 where we also got our first eyes-on look at the processing power it presented via a game called Great Battles: Medieval. It was here that we got our first glance at a quad core processor working on a mobile platform, and as it was said back then, multi-core processing is, and will continue to be, massively important to mobile computing. What NVIDIA provides us today is a stripped-down and simple look at why the next generation, quad core, is much better than dual core in basically every way.


Back Story
A little bit more information about Kal-El before we continue: first, Qualcomm says “we’re not worried about [it]“, then we hear that the Asus Eee Pad Transformer 2 would be likely for the hero device for Kal-El, the quad core processor rumored to be likely for a 2011 holiday season release. You should know that I and we have declared 2011 to be the year of NVIDIA dominating Android Superphones and tablets, that one of the first Kal-El, and that NVIDIA has promised developer support for the Windows 8 platform for anyone willing to work to optimize their apps and games for the Kal-El quad core environment.
Also, on a separate note, you can get more information on NVIDIA’s GPU roadmap in a post from early August, 2011.
Dual to quad
Now today we get to see NVIDIA explaining what it means to have a quad core processor working in the mobile environment. What Project Kal-El was spawned from was the success of the Tegra 2 dual-core platform which, before production, was assumed to be a power-hungry hog for all the benefits is presented. Instead, because less power was needed to power two cores than was needed to power one, (this discussed in the White Paper entitled “Benefit of Multiple CPU cores in Mobile Devices” [.PDF]), NVIDIA went another step down the rabbit hole and brought out 4 cores. 
vSMP and an extra, fifth, core
Project Kal-El works with a new Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing technology, also known as vSMP. As NVIDIA notes today for the first time, vSMP includes a fifth CPU core called the “Companion” core that’s built using a “special low power silicon process” which works on tasks at a low frequency – this works well for active standby mode, music playback, and video playback. The other main four cores are made in a more standard silicon process which is able to reach much higher frequencies. Each of these five cores is an identical ARM Cortex A9 CPU that’s individually enabled and disabled based on work load.
Higher Performance per Watt and Lower Power Consumption
Believe it or not, the quad core processor consumes less power and provides higher performance per watt than dual core processors AND single core processors. Because a quad core processor is able to share workload between multiple cores instead of rocking it all out on one, the work gets done faster and the workload doesn’t hit any one core with every bit of a task – this compared to any device with less cores shows the benefit of the multiple cores the same way five guys can make five burgers faster than one guy can make five burgers, and they’re all a lot less greasy than that one guy would have been.
Faster Web Page Loading Time
Two modern web browsers at least, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, are optimized for use with multi-core processors. Each tab on Chrome is a separate process and each process manages its own threads. The chat you see below shows CPU percentage used over an amount of time as four different webpages are loaded. Each core takes processes from tabs separately, all four cores working concurrently, getting the job done faster, quite simply, when it comes right down to it.

Moonbat Benchmark also shows off the four cores by showing how fast a processor processes Javascript, contending against a dual core processor for kicks. Moonbat here shows an almost 50% increase in performance compared to the provided dual core CPU. 

Demanding Applications of the Future
High performance doesn’t let itself shine here in the quad-core world unless it needs to shine. Therefor NVIDIA works with developers to create games that make full use of their ultra-powerful SoCs. NVIDIA has provided here a list of future possibilities for apps that’ll utilize the quad-core landscape:
• High quality video editing
• Image processing
• Audio/video transcoding
• Physics simulations
• Numerous productivity apps
• Many forms of location-aware computing
• Facial recognition
• 3D stereo games and applications
• Virus scans
• File compression
Next there’s Coremark, a CPU benchmark which shows CPU work across intensive multimedia applications. Here each of several of the top dual-core brands are compared to quad core Kal-El. You’ll find that Kal-El delivers almost two times the performance of dual core processors, this happening across the board (with Texas Instruments’ OMAP 4 coming in second, if you’d like to know, but not by a long shot.)

Linpack is another benchmark the folks at NVIDIA run, here showing the difference between, interestingly enough, a dual core Project Kal-El processor and a full quad core processor (with, again, all four cores turned on instead of just the two.) You’ll find that the quad core processor wins by another long-shot.

Gaming
Most of the best game engines out there, Unreal 3.0, Id Tech 5 and Frostbite, are already multi-threaded and made for multi-core processors. Game engines are currently trending toward task-processing models with the sizes of individual jobs being reduced while number of threads is increased. Real-Time Physics and Rual-Time Texture Generation are but two tools used by the quad core platform to out-perform all competition.

With the power of four cores behind a user, they may turn to apps that create the environment in which they live AS they go about living. What I mean by this is, basically, if you’re playing Glowball, the textures, reactions to events, and physics change as you advance through the game, processed in real-time. Gaming performance speedup shown between the dual core Tegra 2 and the quad core Project Kal-El is plain to see on several different quad core utilizing games.

The game you want to play closest attention to here is Glowball as NVIDIA has already provided us with a look at the game which is yet unreleased and has shown us what quad core is truly and impressively capable of. Real time created environment created by you as you advance through it. Almost like you are processor god! The same goes for real time physics processed on the fly – if you don’t need it to start the game up right after you download it, you don’t need to include it.

Glowball is a game that for now just acts as a reference point for Kal-El. In the future it will be released as a full game for the masses.

One example of not needing all the information loaded by your game each time it loads is this: while the Windmill game (pictured above) generates texturess and racks up a 300 MB data limit, all of this using only a 900 KB base texture set. This means that a game capable of delivering 300 MB of graphics can also have those graphics, as they’re generated, with only 1 MB to start when you pick the device up from the store. What store would that be? We’ll see soon enough!

NVIDIA says Tegra 3 is a 'PC-class CPU,' has screenshots to prove it

Asus can't be absorbing all those limelight photons today. Not when its freshly detailed Transformer Prime depends so heavily on NVIDIA's special sauce. Admittedly, we already know a lot about Tegra 3 from its Kal-El days, but we haven't seen much in the way of real-world performance claims. Until now, that is. Below you'll see newly released screenshots of Android games that have been souped-up to capitalize on the imminent Asus Eee Pad as well as other Tegra 3-powered devices -- including smartphones -- that are expected early next year. NVIDIA has also put out slides containing in-house benchmarks and head-to-head comparisons with the Tegra 2, which you'll find right after the break.

		One last slide, showing how the designers behind RipTide added water splashes and motion blur to increase the game's sense of speed. Check out the slide gallery above for more examples at a better res.

NVIDIA GPUs Now Power World’s 10 Greenest Supercomputers

By Sumit Gupta on
				November 20, 2013




The just-published Green500 list of the world’s most energy-efficient supercomputers shows that the top 10 systems are all powered by NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.
The only other architecture ever to have cleanly swept the 10 top spots on the list is IBM’s legendary BlueGene system.
Crowned the greenest supercomputer, the Tsubame-KFC system at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, hit a record 4.5 gigaflops per watt. That’s about 25 percent more efficient than the list’s number-two, Cambridge University’s Wilkes, at 3.6 gigaflops per watt. In third place was the system at Japan’s Center for Computational Sciences, at the University of Tsukuba, at 3.5 gigaflops per watt.
Tokyo Institute of Technology’s Satoshi Matsuoka (center) receives the Green500 prize for Tsubame-KFC, the world’s most efficient supercomputer. He’s flanked by NVIDIA’s Sumit Gupta (right), GM of Tesla Accelerated Computing, and Wu-chun Feng, organizer of the Green500 and Associate Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech.
NVIDIA’s presence at the top of the Green500 is in the ascendant. Just six months ago, only two of the top 10 systems were accelerated by our GPUs.
At the heart of this trend is the spread of NVIDIA Tesla GPU accelerators based on our Kepler architecture. Launched last year, they are three times more energy efficient than the Fermi-based family of processors they succeeded.
Efficiency has, obviously, become an increasingly key consideration for supercomputing systems as they’ve gotten faster. The largest supercomputers can consume megawatts of power, pushing their annual energy costs into the tens of millions of dollars.
Improving energy efficiency is central to achieving exascale computing – that is, delivering supercomputers that run 50 times faster than today’s best – at a speed of 1 exaflops, or a million trillion flops.
For that, we’ll need a tenfold increase in efficiency – with systems running at 50 gigaflops per watt, according to an SC13 talk by the University of Tennessee’s Jack Dongarra, at NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Theater today.
That may, on its face, sound challenging. But bear in mind that the new Green500 list shows that we’ve achieved a better than tenfold gain in efficiency since the November 2007 list, when the top system, at England’s Daresbury Laboratory, was running at only 0.3 gigaflops a watt.
Clean sweep: The ten fastest systems on the Green500 list of most efficient supercomputers include our Tesla accelerators.

Wow that is an incredible achievement. Very well done. Congratulations!

Sarah Pedersen



When I read this article I could not believe it. You actually achieved to power the top ten greenest supercomputers with your graphics cards. That is no small feat to achieve and it shows your dedication towards protecting the enviroment. My sincere congratulations and keep up this amazing work, Nvidia.


 #comment-## 



Sumit Gupta



This is all due to the Kepler architecture in our new GPUs.   Super energy efficient.  We use the same architecture in supercomputers and in phones!


 #comment-## 



Appstar Financial



I came
  across your post and i found nice information which is done by you,thanks for
  sharing.


 #comment-## 



Theo Valich



Technically speaking, you *will* use the same architecture once the next-gen Tegra launches (soon?   ). BTW, snazzy scarf – a strong fashion statement.  


 #comment-## 



Simon Leinen



So the trick to win this is to use the slowest/least power-hungry Xeon variant in addition to the Kepler boards… right?


 #comment-## 



Sumit Gupta



Yes, Kepler is low power enough, that we can use the same GPU in our next generation Tegra mobile SoCs.
On scarf: you should have come to Supercomputing; we gave it out at our booth.


 #comment-## 



Sumit Gupta



The folks that compete to get on Green500 run several experiments to find the point where they get the maximum performance at the lowest power.   The KFC experiments are detailed here: http://www.el.gsic.titech.ac.jp/~endo/kfc-slides-sc13booth.pdf

Theo Valich



I’d wish if I could come, but I had to take couple of months ‘off’ the conference trek and set up the operations in my businesses. Happy spending the past month in S’pore.   See you in early 2014.

TESTING NVIDIA VS. AMD IMAGE QUALITY

By Nick Stam on
				November 19, 2010




PC gaming enthusiasts understand image quality (IQ) is a critical part of the PC gaming experience. They frequently upgrade their GPUs to play the latest games at high frame rates, while also dialing up the display resolution and graphical IQ effects to make their games both look and play great. Image quality is important, and if it were not important, we’d all be playing at 10×7 with no AA!
Important Benchmarking Issues and Questionable Optimizations
We are writing this blog post to bring broader attention to some very important image quality findings uncovered recently by top technology Web sites including ComputerBase, PC Games Hardware, Tweak PC, and 3DCenter.org. They all found that changes introduced in AMD’s Catalyst 10.10 default driver settings caused an increase in performance and a decrease in image quality. These changes in AMD’s default settings do not permit a fair apples-to-apples comparison to NVIDIA default driver settings. NVIDIA GPUs provide higher image quality at default driver settings, which means comparative AMD vs. NVIDIA testing methods need to be adjusted to compensate for the image quality differences.
What Editors Discovered
Getting directly to the point, major German Tech Websites ComputerBase and PC Games Hardware (PCGH) both report that they must use the “High” Catalyst AI texture filtering setting for AMD 6000 series GPUs instead of the default “Quality” setting in order to provide image quality that comes close to NVIDIA’s default texture filtering setting. 3DCenter.org has a similar story, as does TweakPC. The behavior was verified in many game scenarios. AMD obtains up to a 10% performance advantage by lowering their default texture filtering quality according to ComputerBase.
AMD’s optimizations weren’t limited to the Radeon 6800 series. According to the review sites, AMD also lowered the default AF quality of the HD 5800 series when using the Catalyst 10.10 drivers, such that users must disable Catalyst AI altogether to get default image quality closer to NVIDIA’s “default” driver settings.
Going forward, ComputerBase and PCGH both said they would test AMD 6800 series boards with Cat AI set to ”High”, not the default “Quality” mode, and they would disable Cat AI entirely for 5800 series boards (based on their findings, other 5000 series boards do not appear to be affected by the driver change).

Filter Tester Observations
Readers can observe AMD GPU texture shimmering very visibly in videos posted at TweakPC. The popular Filter Tester application from 3DCenter.org was used with its “ground2” texture (located in the Program Files/3DCenter Filter Tester/Textures directory), and texture movement parameters were set to -0.7 in both X and Y directions with 16xAF enabled. Each video shows the split-screen rendering mode of the Filter Tester application, where the GPU under test is on the left side, and the “perfect” software-based ALU rendering is on the right side. (Playing the videos with Firefox or Google Chrome is recommended). NVIDIA GPU anisotropic quality was also tested and more closely resembles the perfect ALU software-based filtering. Problems with AMD AF filtering are best seen when the textures are in motion, not in static AF tests, thus the “texture movement” settings need to be turned on in the Filter Tester. In our own testing with Filter Tester using similar parameters, we have seen that the newly released Catalyst 10.11 driver also has the same texture shimmering problems on the HD 5870. Cat 10.11 does not work with HD 6000 series boards as of this writing.
AF Tester Observations
ComputerBase also says that AMD drivers appear to treat games differently than the popular “AF Tester” (anisotropic filtering) benchmark tool from 3DCenter.org. They indicate that lower quality anisotropic filtering is used in actual games, but higher quality anisotropic filtering is displayed when the AF Tester tool is detected and run. Essentially, the anisotropic filtering quality highlighted by the AF Tester tool on AMD GPUs is not indicative of the lower quality of anisotropic filtering seen in real games on AMD GPUs.
NVIDIA’s own driver team has verified specific behaviors in AMD’s drivers that tend to affect certain anisotropic testing tools. Specifically, AMD drivers appear to disable texture filtering optimizations when smaller window sizes are detected, like the AF Tester tool uses, and they enable their optimizations for larger window sizes. The definition of “larger” and “smaller” varies depending on the API and hardware used. For example with DX10 and 68xx boards, it seems they disable optimizations with window sizes smaller than 500 pixels on a side. For DX9 apps like the AF Tester, the limit is higher, on the order of 1000 pixels per side. Our driver team also noticed that the optimizations are more aggressive on RV840/940 than RV870, with optimizations performed across a larger range of LODs for the RV840/940.
FP16 Render Observations
In addition to the above recent findings, for months AMD had been performing a background optimization for certain DX9 applications where FP16 render targets are demoted to R11G11B10 render targets, which are half the size and less accurate. When recently exposed publically, AMD finally provided a user visible control panel setting to enable/disable, but the demotion is enabled by default.  Reviewers and users testing DX9 applications such as Need for Speed Shift or Dawn of War 2, should uncheck the “Enable Surface Format Optimization” checkbox in the Catalyst AI settings area of the AMD control panel to turn off FP16 demotion when conducting comparative performance testing.
A Long and Winding Road
For those with long memories, NVIDIA learned some hard lessons with some GeForce FX and 3DMark03 optimization gone bad, and vowed to never again perform any optimizations that could compromise image quality.  During that time, the industry agreed that any optimization that improved performance, but did not alter IQ, was in fact a valid “optimization”, and any optimization that improved performance but lowered IQ, without letting the user know, was a “cheat”.  Special-casing of testing tools should also be considered a “cheat”.
Both NVIDIA and AMD provide various control panel knobs to tune and tweak image quality parameters, but there are some important differences — NVIDIA strives to deliver excellent IQ at default control panel settings, while also ensuring the user experiences the image quality intended by the game developer. NVIDIA will not hide optimizations that trade off image quality to obtain faster frame rates. Similarly, with each new driver release, NVIDIA will not reduce the quality of default IQ settings, unlike what appears to be happening with our competitor, per the stories recently published.
We are glad that multiple top tech sites have published their comparative IQ findings. If NVIDIA published such information on our own, without third-party validation, much of the review and technical community might just ignore it. A key goal in this blog is not to point out cheats or “false optimizations” in our competitor’s drivers. Rather it is to get everyone to take a closer look at AMD’s image quality in games, and fairly test our products versus AMD products. We also want people to beware of using certain anisotropic testing tools with AMD boards, as you will not get image quality results that correspond with game behavior.
AMD promotes “no compromise” enthusiast graphics, but it seems multiple reviewers beg to differ.
We have had internal discussions as to whether we should forego our position to not reduce image quality behind your back as AMD is doing.  We believe our customers would rather we focus our resources to maximize performance and provide an awesome, immersive gaming experience without compromising image quality, than engage in a race to the IQ gutter with AMD.
We’re interested to know what you think here in the comments or on the NVIDIA forums.

Well, I’ve got a similar experience of Nvidia cards. I got a 8600M GT in my laptop and it’s hot enough to make toddy by placing a small glass of rum right next to the fan exhaust. Fortunately the piece is still running but for how long?
I used a 6800 Ultra-card in my previous desktop build and after half a year it started showing graphical artifacts when running Need 4 Speed. Mind you the case was well ventilated.
A year ago I built a new computer using a Radeon 5850 and it’s never ever given me any problems of this kind. This is my own scenario and probably differs a lot from other users’ experience. What it boils down to is this: as long as I’ve been using Nvidia-cards, I’ve had issues with overheating and graphical artifacts. When I switched to ATI/AMD those issues went away.
To top it off, you guys (Nvidia) made fools of yourself with the whole Fermi launch, and now you’re trying to get a cheap shot at the competition by posting slander? I understand competition is fierce but what about making “honesty” and “commitment” part of your repertoire instead of simply flexing your muscles and going “RAARGH, BIGGEST GPU WINS!”…


 #comment-##

I was wondering why guys were late to find this out.  I have felt this difference from the time 5000 series launched.  Even in review sites (guru3d, anandtech, etc.) when they post screenshots of games, there is a glaring difference in image quality. Whatever it maybe, NVIDIA’s graphic cards had the better image quality overall.  And as Joe Eklund said, NVIDIAs drivers are the best and no nonsense.


 #comment-##

nvidia is very pathetic….


 #comment-## 



TwilightVampire



Remember during the GeForce FX days, you guys were guilty of this too. In my opinion, nVidia has no room to talk on this subject.
Most PC gaming enthusiasts already re-adjust IQ settings to their liking anyway. Defaults mean little to nothing. And official benchmarking is done with the lowest IQ settings for every FPS or 3dmark point possible. Just like it was a moot point in 2003 when nVidia was guilty of this, its still a moot point today when AMD is guilty of it.


 #comment-## 



Play3r



has this been tested with the older 5000 or even 4000 series? or only with the 6000 series. testing on 2 very resently release graphics cards could just been they are ironing out the bugs in the drivers. It happens for both side everytime they release something new. there are always driver issues. and do the test with the 10.11 and see.


 #comment-## 



connta



great, i have slightly worse image quality (which i can correct in driver settings and guess what quality and high quality make up for 2-5fps difference and no real IQ difference as far as my eyes are capable to see)…
on the other hand i do not have a power guzzling card and heat nightmare, my southbridge used to overheat from nvidia cards… yeah, SB overheats and my comp crash, can you set that to “cooler” in driver settings (since i can set high quality) without making my comp sound like a jet? no sir. that is why you fail, complete, “rounded” product is important. very important.
and all these sites are german. how come no one else found and published this? i don’t see anything on so many other respectable sites… for one guru3d.com said that there is no real difference in IQ and you know what, moving from gtx260 to 6870 i didnt either. a bit fishy my kind sir…

the nvidia cg compiler did use a lower precision in 3dmark, but there was NEVER a glaringly obvious decrease in quality.

I’ve tested from Release 257 to CUDA Development 263.06, all of these set the supersampling – alpha test setting that does not benefit from a higher FSMSAA mode.
I was contemplating moving to a GTX 500 series card eventually but i didn’t want part of the reason to be getting TrMSAA back without needing 3rd party tools xD

NVIDIA caught cheating in HAWX 2 benchmarks:

AA IQ is lowered to raise the performance. Dear NVIDIA, maybe you should focus on making better products instead of trying to paint the competition black?


 #comment-## 



Jon



Please stop posting, you make yourself look like a tool.
“In a nutshell, the HawX application requests the highest possible AA “sample quality” at a particular AA level from our driver. Without our driver fix, the game would be running 16xCSAA instead of standard 4xAA when you select 4xAA in-game. It runs the proper 4xAA with the driver fix. You defeat the fix by changing the .exe name, causing it to run at 16xCSAA.”

Nick Stam @ NVIDIA



Hi Psycoz.
Please see this story where I explain the HawX issue:
http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/carl/nvidias-nick-stam-addresses-hawx-cheating-allegations 
Also, Hilbert at Guru3D showed the perf gains that we’re concerned about by AMD’s stepping down default IQ. Diceman is right that it’s most obvious in motion, not still shots. Even though Hilbert doesn’t think the actual default IQ degradation is a real big deal IQ-wise (which we disagree given all people who used to argue that we needed to improve our default IQ in the past, and not have any texture shimmer, etc, and now all of the sudden it’s acceptable to the community for AMD default settings to have texture shimmer???….), he does say this in conclusion:
“We urge and recommend AMD/ATI to disable the optimization at default in future driver releases and deal with the performance loss, as in the end everything is about objectivity and when you loose consumer trust, which (as little as it is) has been endangered, that in the end is going to do more harm then good. The drop in 3-4 FPS on average is much more acceptable then getting a reputation of being a company that compromises on image quality. And sure it raises other questions, does ATI compromise on other things as well ? See, the cost already outweigh the benefits. So the moral right thing to do for AMD/ATI is to make the High Quality setting the standard default. But again here we have to acknowledge that it remains a hard to recognize and detect series of optimizations, but it is there and it can be detected.”

Monkey Boy



What? You guys were deliberately caught cheating in the past. It was blatantly obvious! Whereas, in AMD’s case, not so much so. In fact, in he linked Guru3d article, the writer even states that they are incapable of discerning a real difference between the two IQ levels.


 #comment-## 



Monkey Boy



Also, why are some people saying they have to change the IQ for Nvidia cards with the recent driver releases? Here, I’ll provide a quote and exact link.
“I just sold my 5870 couple weeks ago for a 580 GTX.
Yes its true, I had to set my options from Quality to High Quality in the ATI drivers….this is something I have know since the 1900xt days….
But since I just installed my 580 GTX. I ALSO HAD TO SET IT FROM QUALITY TO HIGH QUALITY IN THE NVIDIA DRIVERS.
Why isnt this the article as well?
Seemed Biased to me.
And this is coming from someone who just had an AMD product to Nvidia… ”

bore_u2_death



Directly quoted from the article published on http://www.guru3d.com comparing AMD and nVIDIA image quality.
“The optimization however allows ATI to gain 6% up to 10% performance at very little image quality cost. And I choose the words ‘very little’ here very wisely. The bigger issue and topic at hand here is no-matter what, image quality should be 100% similar in-between the graphics card vendors for objective reasons.
So what does that optimization look like in real world gaming. Well it’s really hard to find actually.
We seriously had a hard time finding an application where the optimizations show well. So mind you, the above example is catered  to show the image quality anomaly.
This is Mass effect, 16xAF and Trinlinear filtering enabled in the configuration file. We are in the spaceship and have positioned ourselves with a surface area where the optimization should show really well. Yet we have a more complex scene with nice textures and lots of colors, much less bland then the simple example shown previously. This time just a Radeon HD 6850 with the optimization on and off and a GeForce GTX 580. 
We have a hard time spotting differences as much as you do, and while making the screenshots we increased gamma settings to 50% and applied a resolution of 2560×1600 to try it look more visible.
Do you spot the difference ? Probably not, that is the rule we life by here at Guru3D, if you can not see it without blowing up the image or altering gamma settings and what not, it’s not a cheat. And sure, we know .. this game title is not a perfect example, it however is a good real world example.”
The ultimate indicator of image quality is that experienced by the end user while using an AMD or nVIDIA graphic card. If the image quality difference in not discernible during normal use, then Catalyst 10.11 is not harmful to image quality.
Just like the quality settings in the nVIDIA Control Panel, the Radeon HD 5000/6000 series GPUs have their Texture Filtering setting at the Quality setting by default. The end user can adjust this to his or her liking at any time. AMD has optimized performance for its most current GPUs at no expense to image quality, and has made its products more competitive at no loss.
Most importantly, you have to deliberately expose a slight difference in IQ during regular gameplay by using Mass Effect, a game from over three years ago by increasing the resolution to 1600p, artificially boosting the brightness beyond what a normal player would use, and then magnify the pixels by zooming in PhotoShop, the image quality loss experienced in that scenario is INVALID.
The claims nVIDIA makes in this article are groundless and invalid in some cases.


 #comment-## 



psycho_biscuit



Groundless? I don’t think I’d call them that. It may not be much of a difference, but it is still a difference. When I’m playing a game and see something like that happening, I’m immediately drawn out of the immersion. The fact they purposefully do this is kind of insulting.
You may need to set NVIDIA’s card from quality to high quality as well; but does their ‘quality’ setting skimp out on anything? I like the idea of having a default setting that is not the highest a card can perform, if you don’t want it to be running as hard. Of course most people will turn it up if they’re needing more fps. 
However, if ATI’s cards have less quality at the default setting, what does that say about their ‘high quality’ setting? Do they try and skimp out on IQ there as well, to say their high quality setting runs faster? Losing trust is extremely detrimental in the eyes of the consumer. This, along with all the crashing of games I have with my ATI card currently because of known issues with certain game engines (even with correct drivers) mean that I won’t be buying from them anymore.
I’ve never had a problem with an NVIDIA card. The only ATI card I’ve ever owned has frustrated me to no end. If they’re skimping out on quality, that’s the nail in the coffin. Give me better, stable quality over a few fps any day.


 #comment-## 



Monkey Boy



This is my first ATI card in 10 years, and I’ve yet to experience a single problem with it. No one is saying AMD is “skimping” out on IQ, since no one can definitely prove it. As the Guru3d states, it’s damn near impossible. Anyone who says they can clearly discern a difference is a blatant liar. The question is, what’s the difference between Nvidia’s quality setting and their high-quality setting? That’s what needs to be asked as well. I want someone to compare and contrast the two quality settings from both companies.


 #comment-## 



bore_u2_death



I applaud AMD for having increased the performance provided by its graphic cards with more effective optimizations.
I challenge nVIDIA to demonstrate a valid scenario where AMD’s newest Cat 10.11 driver compromises on image quality. A valid scenario is only one that can be found during regular gameplay, and not one where old games, high resolutions, certain angles, artificially high brightness, and zoom can combine to allow people to SPLIT HAIRS.
nVIDIA’s claims have NOT been substantiated in any way with real world gameplay. They are GROUNDLESS until proven otherwise.


 #comment-## 



bore_u2_death



And just as a reminder, if anyone is so uncomfortable with a microscopic loss in image quality that has(as of yet) not been proven to be detrimental to the end user that you would rather forfeit a 6-10% increase in performance, you don’t have to stand for it.
 Open Catalyst Control Center, and set the Texture Filtering option to High Quality, which just like nVIDIA, will disable all performance optimizations.
Finished.

Thanks to all the shenanigans NV PR pulls off, this owner of a large LAN game center (we have over 200 gaming machines, with a mix of NV and ATI cards) .. we spend over $20,000 yearly alone on GPUs, I think it’s finally time we rid our systems of Nvidia products, and go full head on with AMD. At the very least we can retire a few Air Conditioners and saving a ton of electricity in the process. We cannot support a Corporation that acts like children.
In our 7 years of operation we have mostly used NV products thanks to their superior build quality and frequent driver updates. However the past few years had NV staggering … they’ve dropped the ball on both build quality and driver updates. That bumpgate fiasco?  Yeah that hurt. With the amount of machines we have, any issue is catastrophic. As our systems are leased, any issues will cause downtime and loss of profits as we wait replacements.
When many of our cards started artifacting, some blowning capacitors, among others takes a machine down we are left with lost profits when the system is down. Out of the hundreds of AMD cards we’ve leased, only a handful have failed. However the same cannot be said for Nvidia. Most of our G80/G92 cards have failed (70%+) with the symptoms I’ve listed above. Note that I did not mention Fermi and I will not need to as that chips’ issues are highly documented on most credible hardware sites.
We have stuck with Nvidia through the good and bad. However it is time to say goodbye. NV isn’t interested in fixing any of it’s own problems and instead resorts to pools to rally up unknown, non-english sites with dirty fingers pointing at AMD is silly.
Farewell and Goodbye.

I read all the comments and it’s really scary how ignorant people can be. The AMD AF optimization is not something you can barely see. It’s a very noticable IQ degradation. You barely see it on screenshots. For this reason the Guru3D article is ridiculous. But you can see it during gameplay.

The longstanding rule has been that there should be no IQ difference between the Quality and High Quality AF settings, and both made an agreement that their Quality settings would have no optimizations that degrade IQ. So if A = B and B = C, then A = C.   
To find out the effect that all these IQ “degradation” means to the end user, I conducted a research with the HardOCP community, asking Radeon HD 5000 and 6000 owners for their opinion. Read on and find out their subjective opinions. As you will see, it doesn’t amount to much.

The videos in the link I’ve posted above show that the Radeons have the shimmering problems even in HQ (which NVidia cards don’t). So Q and HQ comparison does not really matter. Even at best HQ settings the AMD cards have vast IQ issues.

NVIDIA Reveals Tegra Note – Complete Tablet Platform, Powered by Tegra 4

By Matt Wuebbling on
				September 18, 2013




By now many of you may have heard of NVIDIA Tegra Note, but are still wondering what it is.
Back in June at Computex, we briefly demoed an early version of the device, when it was better known as Tegra Tab. One of the many innovations it introduced was NVIDIA DirectStylus technology, which significantly improves passive stylus performance.
So what’s Tegra Note?
It’s a complete tablet platform, designed by NVIDIA and brought to market by our partners.
It embodies the NVIDIA brand — from our hardware and software (right down to OTA updates), to our industrial design, accessories and network of partners in game development.
It elevates the abilities of our partners, so they can provide tablets packed with innovation and features at prices they may not have been able to deliver on their own. In turn, NVIDIA gains access to their deep sales and distribution expertise in regions worldwide.
And it starts at a suggested retail price of $199. That will help many more people experience the new technologies going into Tegra Note, including its 100 percent Android OS.
 
Tegra Note — a complete tablet platform, powered by Tegra 4.
This isn’t a first for us. About a year ago, we announced Project KAI — a Tegra 3 reference design intended as a recipe to build low-cost, high-quality Tegra 3 tablets. Google’s Nexus 7 was one. Tegra Note takes this to the next level by delivering a complete platform, not just the hardware.
In the next few months, our partners will be bringing Tegra Note to market worldwide with features that speak to local consumers, among them are EVGA and PNY Technologies in North America; EVGA, Oysters and ZOTAC in Europe; Colorful, GIGABYTE, Shenzhen Homecare Technology and ZOTAC in Asia-Pacific; and XOLO in India. They join other partners, including HP, ASUS, Toshiba, Kobo and Xiaomi, that have already announced Tegra 4-based products.
To whet your appetite, here’s a rundown on some of the Tegra Note’s unique features:

Ultra-fast performance — Powered by Tegra 4 with a 72-core GeForce GPU and quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU with a fifth battery-saver core, making Tegra Note the world’s fastest 7-inch tablet.
Superb stylus — NVIDIA DirectStylus technology transforms a normal stylus into an incredibly responsive experience with finer point and broader stroke control. It also comes bundled with apps for convenient, stroke-based note taking.
Exceptional sound — NVIDIA PureAudio technology offers rich, deep audio — including the widest frequency range in a tablet — through front-facing stereo speakers with a bass-reflex port.
Groundbreaking camera — The camera uses Tegra 4’s processing power and Chimera computational photography architecture to deliver stunning new features. Tegra Note also brings SmugMug’s Camera Awesome app — one of the top camera apps on iOS — to Android. Camera Awesome delivers exclusive Tegra 4 features like tap-to-track and 100 fps video with slow-motion playback.
TegraZone gaming — Delivering unmatched gaming, NVIDIA TegraZone provides easy access to Tegra-optimized games with visual effects that aren’t available on other tablets. Tegra Note also supports a variety of game controllers for console-class gaming.
Great battery life — 10-plus hours of HD video playback.
Accessories galore — An intelligent slide cover flips and bends to support and cover the tablet. It also lets the tablet be set up in three distinct positions using built-in magnets for added flexibility. The DirectStylus Pro Pack enables a variety of writing styles with interchangeable tips. And Bluetooth capabilities turn the tablet into a game controller.

On top of that, users get over-the-air (OTA) software updates provided directly by NVIDIA. This will help ensure customers have current software, offering the richest experience with their devices.
Here’s a full set of the specs for quick reference:



Processor
Tegra 4 mobile processor with quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU and 72-core GeForce GPU


Display
7-inch HD IPS LCD display (1280 x 800)


Camera
Rear 5MP and front VGA webcam


Storage
16GB storage with microSD expandable up to an additional 32GB


Audio
Front-facing “HD Audio” stereo speakers with a unique bass-reflex port


Stylus
Chisel and Brush tips for natural writing and broad strokes


Peripherals
Micro HDMI connector to drive big screen TV videos and gaming


OS
100% Android with latest version of the OS


Software Updates
Over-the-air software updates directly from NVIDIA


Battery Life
10 hours HD video playback

I was thinking about getting the note 10.1 2014 but now that I hear about this and especially at this price and running mostly stock Android out of the box I say fuck samsung.

MarcoLorenzo



It’s a 7 inch tablet, what do you expect? The DPI is more than enough. At this size, there’s really no point going for anything higher especially when you consider the added advantage lower resolutions provide like performance and battery life.


 #comment-## 



MarcoLorenzo



But at this size it won’t make any difference since your eyes won’t be able to discern the difference anymore.

If it comes to Bulgaria i will take one, like the designe and the price, its perfect for me! And stylus, that is what im missing with ipad… Bought several, but they not fill like to work better with it.

Consider something, I think most of us use to screen more than 40 cm from the eyes, and considering that we have a 7-inch screen, the maximum resolution that the human eye with perfect vision can see is about 1230×820, only ‘ll capture higher resolution screen if you get too close to your eyes, and if you do you are very sick of the eyes and ophthalmologist prescribes need to go to a higher resolution I think the screens should be more than 7 inches. This was done with calculations that include variables such as distance between the eyes cones etc..


 #comment-## 



E. Tasche



Most people actually hold smaller tablets and phones closer to 20-25cm from the eyes during activities like gaming.
There is a lot of existing research out there by people who are qualified to do that sort of thing, ya know?

Isano



Is this going to be available in the Philippines?


 #comment-## 



Doug Dale



The Nexus 7 2nd generation is using a cortex A8 CPU which is nowhere near the power of the Tegra 4 which is based on A15 cores, also I’ve found that the 1280×800 resolution to be plenty acceptable on a 7″ tablet. Pushing ultra resolutions has it’s drawbacks when it comes to performance.

Awesome concept and the wide range masses would love that.,…But if only we have bigger screen with similar or around the price tag…would bring more people in

Google’s eventually going to have to set some standards for apps. Like if you make an app you have to make it for phones AND tablets. And really, I can’t believe Google hasn’t done more to promote using Android in the classroom. Many manufactures, but Google is the driving force.

I disagree there are plenty educational apps on the play store, this device is great for school. I use evernote, and and a few others, I also have a graphing calc app, and a few other apps great for school. I think its just a matter of if you have the will you will find the way. looks like this new tablet will be great for school.

If I’m not mistaken you can emulate most ios on android. Or am I wrong? The tegra 4 could emulate windows xp let alone a mobile UI.

NVIDIA DRIVERS RECEIVE WINDOWS 8 CERTIFICATION

By Chris Daniel on
				May 31, 2012




[Update] 6/27/2012: This morning we posted WHQL-certified GeForce 302.82 drivers for desktop GPUs running the Windows 8 Release Preview (32-bit download, 64-bit download). In order for us to best address your feedback, please direct all comments regarding this GeForce 302.82 driver to the feedback thread on our moderated forums. Notebook users should continue to use GeForce 302.80 drivers (32-bit notebook download, 64-bit notebook download) for the Windows 8 Release Preview.
[Update] 6/15/2012: This morning we posted the beta notebook GeForce 302.80 drivers (32-bit notebook download, 64-bit notebook download) for the Windows 8 Release Preview. In order for us to best address your feedback, please direct all comments regarding this driver to the feedback thread on our moderated forums.
[Update] 6/14/2012: This morning we posted beta desktop GeForce 302.80 drivers (32-bit download, 64-bit download) for the Windows 8 Release Preview. An equivalent driver for GeForce notebook GPUs is planned for tomorrow morning. In order for us to best address your feedback, please direct all comments regarding this driver to the feedback thread on our moderated forums.
[Update] 6/11/2012: We apologize again for the delay of the WHQL-certified driver for the Windows 8 Release Preview. Please know that our software team is working around the clock. Thanks to your comments, we have decided to post a beta driver in advance of the WHQL-certified driver. Our developers are targeting beta driver release in the next 4-8 days.  We’ll update you again on status of the driver, this Friday.
In conjunction with today’s launch of Microsoft Windows 8 Release Preview and the opening of the Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) for Windows 8, NVIDIA has received Windows 8 certification for its new R302 graphics drivers.
The WHQL certification of R302 drivers highlights the fact that NVIDIA is in lock-step with Microsoft and is fully prepared for Windows 8.
The new Windows 8 WHQL-certified GeForce R302 drivers will be available for download early next week from GeForce.com (Note: R302 drivers will be Windows 8 only. Other Windows operating systems will continue to use R300 drivers).
NVIDIA’s Windows 8 drivers support all the features in the new Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) v1.2. The drivers also support award-winning NVIDIA 3D Vision and 3DTV Play products, allowing you to play more than 600 games, watch Blu-ray movies and view photos – all in 3D.
For more information on the Microsoft Windows 8 Release Preview, please visit: http://preview.windows.com
[Update] 6/6/2012: We have decided to postpone the driver release to pick up some additional fixes that we feel are necessary for a great Windows 8 experience. We apologize for the delay and will post the new driver as soon as possible.

the driver restarts at times but its stable on most accounts. I no longer have cuda 5 support but since my card only supports up to cuda 4 this isn’t missed. PhysX and open cl works too.


 #comment-## 



Marc Hanna



Your supported product list isn’t in very good English.. 
This driver will install on the following GPUs with the exception of some notebooks listed below:GeForce 600M series:GeForce GT 635M, GeForce GT 630M, GeForce 610M 
So is my gt630m in the supported or unsupported list considering there’s only one list..
Also Intel chipset hybrid power? So Nvidia optimus doesn’t work either with this driver? 


 #comment-## 



http://www.facebook.com/people/Warren-Taylor/1626673728                Warren Taylor



Installed the new beta driver (desktop 302.80 ) and so far, so good. No PSOD yet.


 #comment-## 



Chris_Daniel



Thanks for the feedback Marc. I will ask our team to update the text. 630M is in the supported list. Optimus is supported (Hybrid power is a different technology).

How about some windows 7 drivers for the gtx 640, 650, 660, 670, 675, or 680 mobile GPUs?  I have a new laptop with a gtx 660m coming next week and Nvidia only has up to date drivers for the 610, 620, 630 and 635.  The ones shipping with the laptop are somewhere around 255.XX.  
It’s ridiculous that Nvidia ships out mobile GPUs without any real support for sometimes months.  Yes, I know they always say that us fools who buy laptops should turn to the laptop manufacturer, but that’s nonsense.  Nvidia should have drivers ready to go the day laptops with their mobile GPUs are available.  
The most ludicrous part of this situation is that when you go to nvidia.com, the first thing you see is a laptop with the GTX 680m.  Then you find out that there are no drivers for it.  Amazing.
Hey Nvidia, how about taking care of the people who are going out of their way to buy laptops with your mobile GPUs?  This is been a problem for years and you have nothing to remedy the situation.

Chris_Daniel



Hi Stuart and Vijay, You are correct that 9400M GPUs are missing from the driver package. I have filed a bug for this issue and will provide an update on Monday. 


 #comment-## 



Chris_Daniel



Hi Syed, we will be posting a Windows 7 beta driver on Monday for notebook GPUs up to and including 675M. While we typically have the first update for new GPUs posted earlier that this and do apologize for that (Windows 8 came at the same time), Verde drivers are post-launch updates, not launch drivers. At launch, the best driver for the notebook is the one that ships with the system and NVIDIA is updating those drivers right up until launch of the product.

Thanks Daniel. Is this update will resolve my freezing /kernal power failue issue?


 #comment-## 



Marc Hanna



Well it would seem my comment has been deleted.. 
So I ask again, because of the bad English on the supported drivers page. IS my graphics chipset, the GT620M SUPPORTED? and finally NVIDIA OPTIMUS? With the BETA DRIVER?

Hi Marc, I answered your question below. It was not deleted. Yes, 620M is supported and so is Optimus.

Why on the driver’s page it is written “Supported Products: 
GeForce 100M series:
G 110M, GT 130M, GTS 160M, G 105M, G 103M, G 102M, GT 120M”? I can’t install the driver on my ASUS K50IN (GeForce 102M)! Please, tell me how can I make it work…I need to finish my win 8 app ASAP. Thanks

So, it’s Monday today. Where are the drivers? Why did you say that the drivers will be available “this week”, if it’s already finished?

Try this work around who are facing freezing issue,
http://www.withinwindows.com/2012/06/28/workaround-for-windows-8-freezing-issues/
The work around worked for me   No freezes .Happy Coding

http://www.robinmajumdar.com                Robin Majumdar



Any timeframe on Quadro series (I use an FX4600 on a 64 bit HP XW8400 workstation) drivers for Win8 Release Preview?
I checked in the downloads area, but the latest driver is for the Consumer Preview… and not something we should be installing on the latest Win8 build.

NVIDIA DOES NOT SUPPORT SOPA

By Bob Sherbin on
				January 12, 2012




NVIDIA wasn’t consulted by ESA in formulating their position on SOPA. Our position is this: we oppose piracy, as it hurts our game-developer partners. However, we do not support SOPA. We don’t believe it is the right solution to the problem. We remain committed to working to address this problem in a constructive and fair manner.

If they want to avoid getting godaddied, maybe they should write an open letter to the ESA, and get other ESA members to sign it with them?

Looks like it’s time to upgrade my graphics card. Well done Nvidia

Faithful nVidia customer from the GF2 times, now with 590 onboard. I love you nVidia, fight the power!

Glad to know, now I might consider buying that GTX 570 that I was saving money to buy, however, if u guys start supporting SOPA, I’ll just start buying ATi instead…


 #comment-## 



dna .



Thank you nVIDIA.  Now, if you really mean it, take it one step further:
Produce a TV ad in which you, along with other like-minded IT companies, announce a statement of solidarity of 100% opposition to SOPA as well as any similar attempts of the future.  Air the ad during Super Bowl.

not supporting SOPA is the smart move…I am probably one out of many consumers out there that would have probably ripped out my nvidia card if they supported SOPA. Surely Nvidia probably took this into consideration before making the decision. I have already canceled my Mastercard due to their support of SOPA and I’m still looking for corporations to break ties with due to their support of SOPA. Hopefully I won’t have to upgrade parts cuz if this lol.


 #comment-## 



geoff butler



i like this statement because they are not supporting it in its current form but if it was radically changed into something that deals with the pirate problem the correct way, they may support it.

well nvidia take a posture…i always buy nvidia since the tnt gpu but this primitive idea sopa cant be tolrerated , that why i would sell my gtx 460 for only $50 and buy AMD

Gaming
NVIDIA – And a Quarter of a Million Gamers – Storm Paris

By Stéphane Quentin on
				October 31, 2013




A quarter of a million gamers are crowding into the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles for Paris Games Week.
And NVIDIA is there, participating in the week’s biggest events: the Electronic Sports World Cup, the LDLC.com PC Modding Trophy, and the NVIDIA League of Legend week tournament, open to all visitors.
Gamers of all levels had a chance to get in on the action.
Expect plenty of competition – and drama – at this week’s Electronic Sports World Cup, produced by Oxent, who know how to turn great gaming into great entertainment.
The Best of the Best
The Electronic Sports World Cup brings together the best PC gamers from around the world, and all the gamers participating in this week’s finals will use PCs equipped with GeForce GTX 760 and 770 GPUs.
Check out the live streaming of the event at http://www.eswc.com/en/live.
Gamers will also find plenty of gear worth ogling – starting with the machines for the LDLC.com PC Modding Trophy. The competition will showcase the creations of six of the best French PC modders.
Each of these machines will be equipped with GeForce GTX GPUs. Visitors will get the chance to vote for their favorites and win some hardware the modders selected to design and build their GeForce GTX-boosted PCs.
Factory Fresh Games
And, of course, our gear will be featured by a wide range of system builders. Visitors to Alienware’s booth at the show will be among the first to get some hands-on time with “Batman: Arkham Origins” in the wake of its release this week.
Lighting up the City of Light: Tournaments, giveaways, and demos drew enormous crowds.
MSI will be giving away extreme gaming machines powered by NVIDIA GPUs.
And attendees will get the chance to participate in gaming tournaments – using NVIDIA equipped PCs – and featuring a number of free to play gaming titles.
For more photos and news from the show, visit our French Facebook page at www.facebook.com/NVIDIAFrance.

Nvidia moves to take on Intel By Jon Fortt August 25, 2008: 10:20 PM ET

 





Inside PCs, components like Nvidia's graphics chips are becoming more important. Photo: HP



For Nvidia, it's showtime.
Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) have long been the most influential companies in the PC world, but lately something is shifting: The latest Intel chip or Microsoft operating system is no longer guaranteed to send technology buyers rushing into stores.
Instead in this visual age, glitzy entertainment features are just as likely to excite shoppers as anything else – and that's why the spotlight is on graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as it holds its first-ever conference - dubbed  NVISION - in Silicon Valley this week. With many of the digital effects industry's A-listers on hand, it's shaping up to be a flashy affair.
Think of the conference as a coming out party of sorts. Over the past several months, co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang has been making the case that Nvidia deserves a place beside Intel as one of the most influential players in the tech hardware business. While Huang and his company are well known among video game fanatics and creative professionals who rely on his chips to bring 3D landscapes and other visual effects to life, he feels now is the time to make a play for a more mainstream audience.
"A lot of people think that what Nvidia does is make graphics chips for video games," Huang said to a huddle of journalists. "We love doing that, and nothing geeks us up more than to do that – but it really is only the tip of the iceberg."
So the show so far is orchestrated to suggest that Nvidia's technology is at the center of some of the most interesting digital trends. During a rambling two-hour keynote address, Huang demonstrated how Nvidia chips allow Lamborghini to use digital models to solicit pre-orders of a limited-edition car that will sell for 1.5 million euros. He also invited presenters to show how graphics processors enable virtual worlds, TV effects, touch-sensitive interfaces and immersive 3D games.
The atmosphere was markedly more casual (and the crowd more sparse) than at the Intel Developer Forum last week in San Francisco, where the chip giant tried to rally the tech industry behind its vision of how Intel chips will eventually power all sorts of digital devices. As things got going Monday in downtown San Jose, the 7,100 attendees included gamers in rumpled t-shirts mingled with engineers in button-downs. Underscoring the rebellious vibe, the fountain outside the San Jose Convention Center was dyed green, in tribute to Nvidia's signature color.
It's a convenient time for a graphics specialist like Nvidia to assert itself. The latest operating systems from Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) make heavy use of visual effects to make the computing experience more engaging, with icons that jump when clicked, and windows that slide in and out of view. Video recording and playback are gaining prominence as higher-quality webcams arrive, and high-definition videos take hold in Blu-ray drives and on YouTube (GOOG).
All of those tasks go more smoothly on a PC with a decent graphics processor. Mark Randall, chief strategist for Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Dynamic Media group, said that his company's software writers are increasingly trying to tap the power of graphics chips as they develop new tools for video editing and web design.
But Huang has even bigger things in mind than traditional graphics fare. With its new Tegra family of mobile chips, the company is seeking a foothold in the emerging market for pocket computers like the iPhone. On the high end, Huang plans to make supercomputing-style power more affordable to businesses through its Cuda environment, which uses a method called parallel computing to take on big jobs for industries including financial services and oil and gas exploration.
Both of these moves position Nvidia for a showdown with Intel, whose Atom chip for mobile devices and upcoming Larrabee chip for graphics appeal to the same markets. Each company is arguing that its approach will provide the most thrilling features to tomorrow's devices. At stake are billions of dollars in potential profits. "The world is converging, and who has the better mousetrap, Nvidia or Intel?" said David Wu, analyst with Global Crown Capital. "That's what I'm going to NVISION to find out."

Nvidia Sees Tegra Growth In Q3, Says WSJ

 article start By Tiernan RayNvidia‘s (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang was kind enough to stop by Dow Jones offices this morning, and I was able to join the discussion, which was hosted by my erstwhile colleague, the Journal’s excellent chip reporter Shara Tibken.
Before I get into a few observations, I would note Shara this afternoon posted an in-depth piece with particular notes on the financial outlook.
In particular, she zeroed in on Huang’s outlook for the “Tegra” mobile chip business. That outlook was somewhat muted when Huang talked following following the company’s fiscal Q2 report last month, , as Shara pointed out. In her article, she writes that Nvidia now sees growth for Tegra this quarter:
“Our genuine conservatism was misinterpreted as absence of growth,” he said. “My sense is that we’re going to grow, and we just wanted to take a more conservative posture in the marketplace, considering some actions that our companies, their various competitors and customers are taking against each other. They’re not within my control or my ability to forecast.” Huang said he initially was cautious with his guidance on concerns about the effect the litigation and other factors would have on sales of tablet computers and smartphones. But he said patent litigation is “just life.”  “At this point, it looks like it’s much ado about nothing,” he said. 
Huang made the point at the opening of the discussion that Nvidia has moved away from the Intel (INTC) chipset business that was its bread and butter for years, and is now in two growth businesses, discrete graphics processors (GPUs) and the “Tegra” line of application processors for tablets and smartphones.
Huang says the latest version of Tegra, “Tegra 3,” code-named “Kal-El,” is getting more design wins than Tegra 2, and that devices with the chip will be on the market in time for the U.S. holiday season. “This quarter or Q4″ is what he said.
Huang sees Tegra being a $1 billion business next year.
Much of the discussion was about Qualcomm (QCOM), which Huang sees as really the only viable competitor to Nvidia. He dismissed Texas Instrument (TXN) buzz in the tablet market — it is widely regarded as a “reference device” for the forthcoming “Ice Cream Sandwich” version of Google’s (GOOG) “Android” operating system.
“We were never in any of the reference devices,” says Huang, and yet Nvidia managed to scoop up several wins with its last Tegra processor. “I think TI is desperately trying to hold onto something,” he said, when asked about TI’s “OMAP” processor business. “I think they just don’t invest enough, and they need to decide if they’re going to invest.” Huang was referring to TI’s lack of software innovation. He says most of Nvidia’s engineering staff is focused on software as a key differentiator in the smartphone and tablet market.
Another interesting thread of the meeting was Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 8, about which Huang was extremely enthusiastic. By the end of next year, he expects Nvidia’s Tegra will be in both tablets and PCs running Windows 8.
The same $199 PC that is the bottom-of-the-barrel today will be “exquisite” when running Windows 8, said Huang. It will be super light, and will have a battery running for days and days. Making the equivalent of Apple‘s (AAPL) MacBook “Air” running on an processor based on ARM Holdings (ARMH) designs will be trivial, Huang suggested.
Although Windows on a phone has been “tainted” at this point, and  Microsoft must woo customers back, he warns one not to rule out  Microsoft in any of these markets.
Huang will be speaking later today at the Citigroup technology conference in Manhattan, shortly after 4 pm. So be sure to keep an eye or an ear out for that.
And in case you were wondering, Huang uses primarily a Samsung “Galaxy R” smartphone, running on Tegra, of course.
Nvidia shares today are down 21 cents, or 1.6%, at $12.71.

Nvidia Releases GeForce GTX 580M, Mobile Graphics Chip Promises Fastest Speeds Ever

By Avram Piltch, LAPTOP Online Editorial Director
 | 
Jun 28, 2011 09:00 AM EST











Nvidia has upped the ante for mobile gamers once again with the announcement of the GeForce GTX 580M graphics card, which promises the fastest 3D gaming experience of all time. The new chip will appear in a number of high-end gaming notebooks including the upcoming Alienware M18x and the updated Alienware M17x.
The GTX 580M offers a host of high-performance features, including:

DirectX 11 Support: Ability to support the latest, high-end Windows games.
Optimus: Now even high-end gaming systems will have Nvidia’s automatic graphics switching technology. On internal tests, Nvidia found that 17-inch notebooks were able to go from 3 to 5 hours of endurance (doing Facebook) due to Optimus.
PhysX ability: More realistic explosions with fragments that fly all over the place in realistic ways.
High-speed 3D Vision Gaming: Improved frame rates, even during 3D games.
Tessalation Support: More realistic textures. See the picture below.


SLI Support: Ability to double frame rates by adding a second GTX 580M card to your notebook
High-end Specs: 384 CUDA Cores, 1.2-GHz GPU clock, 2GB of DDR5 RAM, 256-bit memory bus




In addition to the GTX 580M, Nvidia also announced the release of a slightly-less-powerful chip, the GTX 570M. The GTX 570M supports 336 CUDA Cores, a 1.1-GHz GPU, 1.5 or 3GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. The MSI GT780R will be the first notebook to come with a GTX 570M chip installed.

Nvidia gets major props for Project Denver
Posted February 2, 2011 - 16:40
 by 
 Aharon Etengoff

 Nvidia's decision to develop an indigenous ARM-based microprocessor brand has won major props from a number of analysts, including Matthew Wilkins of IHS iSuppli.
"Nvidia's entry into the microprocessor segment makes sense, despite the current market dominance of Intel and AMD," explained Wilkins. 
"In notebook PCs alone, [we] forecast the penetration rate for graphics-enabled MPUs will increase to 82.9 percent by 2014, up from 39 percent in 2010. This presents an opening for Nvidia to make inroads into the MPU market."  
According to Wilkins, a new supplier entering the MPU space will act as a "catalyst for innovation," thereby directly benefiting end users.
Nevertheless, the analyst emphasized that Nvidia will face a definite challenge of actualization in the software realm. 
"The PC market is [currently ruled] by x86 microprocessor architecture, and software used on these computers is written for x86 hardware.
"[As such], Nvidia's challenge [will be] to create products that interest independent software vendors (ISVs) to the extent that they port their existing PC applications or write new programs for ARM-based microprocessors."
As TG Daily previously reported, one major ISV - Microsoft - has already joined the RISC-based club by announcing that future versions of its flagship Windows OS (and Office suite) will be ARM-friendly.  
So, what are Nvidia's chances of taking on AMD and Intel with Project Denver?
Well, IHS believes that during the short term, the company is like to "attain success" in tablets and low-end notebooks, where price and an intuitive interface are key factors in attracting the attention of consumers.
 
Of course, the server market is likely to present additional challenges for Nvidia, simply because the corporate world is understandably conservative about selecting new hardware suppliers for mission-critical applications.   
"The server market's transition from reduced instruction ser computing (RISC) MPUs to x86-based chips took many years. [Yet], as data centers grow in size because of increasing demand for cloud computing, power consumption is becoming an increasing concern," said Wilkins.
"ARM MPUs, on the other hand, are renowned for being stingy on power. Because of this, IHS expects Nvidia to focus extensively on the server segment with its Project Denver products."

Jen-Hsun Huang has always said his graphics chips were good for more than rendering explosions of zombie maniacs in videogames. In October the 
 
  Nvidia
  
 chief executive got his proof when scientists at China’s National Supercomputer Center in Tianjin unveiled the Tianhe-1A, the fastest computer on earth. The beast sucks up 4 megawatts of power to forecast weather and survey mines at a speed of 2.5 quadrillion calculations per second. In it are 7,200 Nvidia graphics processors.
Now Huang wants (and needs) to put some of that power in your pocket. Nvidia still leads the market for high-end graphics processors in desktop computers, but Huang needs to tap the fast-growth markets for smartphones and tablets before things worsen. 
 
  Intel
  
 and AMD are muscling it aside with all-in-one products that combine graphics with their microprocessors. Intel has already pushed Nvidia out of the business of supplying computer chip sets, the digital nervous system that all processors plug into to power PCs and laptops. Nvidia is suing Intel for the right to build chip sets that work with Intel’s latest processors. 
“They’re getting squeezed in the middle,” says analyst Jon Peddie of Nvidia. “So they’re moving up and moving down.”
Huang says his specialized chips will deliver enough extra graphics power to compete with these all-in-one offerings. He also counters that in a mobile world the aging x86 processor technology Intel and AMD have been riding for decades isn’t as important as the stripped-down, power-efficient designs from the likes of 
 
  Qualcomm
  
, 
 
  Apple
  
, Samsung and 
 
  Texas Instruments
  
. They all license their architecture from British firm ARM, which Nvidia cut a deal with in 2005 for its Tegra mobile processors. Each comes with a brawny graphics engine that efficiently races through many tasks at once. The Nvidia supercomputer, for example, uses one-third the power of a comparable machine powered solely by x86 CPUs. 
So far the Tegra chip has few customers. 
 
  Microsoft
  
 uses it in its Zune digital media player. Seen one lately? Tegra generated less than $52 million in sales in the most recent quarter, or 6% of Nvidia’s total. Huang is promising a spate of new products next year tied to 
 
  Google
  
‘s newest version of Android smartphone software. South Korea’s LG has said it’s readying a phone using a Tegra processor. 
 
  Motorola
  
 is reportedly doing the same.
Huang sees a day when mobiles with graphics cores will be able to identify objects through a camera, much like Tony Stark’s visor did in Iron Man 2. “To make that happen you need a supercomputer with all kinds of parallel-processing capability and a mobile device with parallel-processing capabilities. By connecting them you have a supercomputer in your hand,” Huang says.

Nvidia Fires Back at Intel – With Cartoons
Nvidia Fires Back at Intel – With CartoonsBy Mark Hachman on November 5, 2009 at 2:52 pmCommentShare This article Nvidia has quietly begun taking aim at Intel through a series of editorial cartoons, poking fun at the chip giant through a site known as IntelsInsides.com. Nvidia representatives and the cartoonist himself confirmed that Nvidia hosts the site, which is also linked to on its corporate blog. So far, IntelsInsides.com has only poked fun at Intel, although Bob Sherbin, Nvidia’s head of corporate communications, said that other targets could be forthcoming.“[The site] is satirical in nature, and attempts to have a bit of fun with what is quite a serious issue,” Sherbin said of the most recent topics, which have involved Intel’s alleged use of market development funds and rebates to illegally obstruct rival AMD. “The spotlight is on them regarding this issue, and so they are a very obvious target.”So far, all of the single-panel cartoons have been drawn by Steven Lait, a freelance editorial cartoonist whose work has appeared in the Bay Area News Group. Sherbin said that topics for the strips are “discussed” over e-mail, and that the collaboration goes both ways.The most recent parody shows Intel chief executive Paul Otellini claiming that “I did not have bribery, coercion, and kickback relations with the computer industry,” a reference to President Clinton’s denial that he did “not have sexual relations with” Monica Lewinsky. Later, of course, Clinton admitted an affair. “Intel’s Insides is intended to be a parody of events occurring within the semiconductor sector, with particular focus on its largest, and most-commented-upon competitor,” according to a note posted on the site. Companies poking fun at a competitor is nothing new; Verizon, for example, has run recent commercials mocking the lighthearted style of the Apple iPhone ads, while pointing out rival AT&T’s shortcomings. (A more direct attack on AT&T’s 3G coverage has prompted a lawsuit, however.) Apple, of course, has mocked the PC industry for years, and Microsoft’s Windows 7 is its latest target. A site featuring cartoons designed to mock a competitor, however, may be something new for the technology industry. And Nvidia might be said to have an ax to grind, as an ongoing legal battle with Intel has caused Nvidia to halt its nForce chipset development. An analyst used that development to argue that Nvidia may enter the x86 microprocessor market in the near future. When asked for comment, Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy acknowledged that he had seen the site, and asked why Nvidia did not place the site inside its own domain, or “a place where it clearly states that they are behind it.” For his part, Sherbin said that the site is quite clearly linked to on the Nvidia blog. A small Nvidia logo also appears near the cartoon, along with the disclaimer that the Web site is not provided, sponsored, or endorsed by Intel.Mulloy, however, said the representations were not accurate. “It’s not cute, it’s not accurate, it is Nvidia being Nvidia,” he said in an e-mail.

Nvidia Tunes 3D Offerings for Businesses


Nvidia is extending its 3D offerings from homes to businesses, announcing new 3D glasses and transmitters for use in meetings and presentations. The products in Nvidia's new 3D Vision Pro portfolio could help multiple participants look into a single 3D screen from up to 100 feet away, said Scott Fitzpatrick, product manager for Nvidia's Quadro business unit. Users could also look into multiple 3D screens in a room depending on how transmitters, glasses and workstations are configured.The transmitters and glasses communicate wirelessly using RF technology that has a range of up to 100 feet. That is a longer range than is afforded by the infrared technology used by current products in the 3D Vision portfolio. With an extended range, users can move freely inside a room and still see 3D images on a screen, said Andrew Page, senior product manager of 3D Vision Pro at Nvidia. The original 3D Vision kit requires users to stand within the line of sight.The longer range helps extend the 3D images on one screen to more users, Page said. Traditional 3D installations would have required multiple infrared transmitters, but 3D Vision Pro requires just one hub. Hubs with transmitters can also operate in range of each other, each working on its own channel."The easiest model to think of is wireless mice -- you can connect one or more mice to your computer, but your neighbor's mouse doesn't interfere with your computer," Page said.A hub connects to a workstation and talks with a graphics processing unit (GPU) inside the PC. Stereoscopic 3D involves delivering a slightly separate view to the left and right eye, and the GPU instructs the hub how to break down the images, which the hub then relays to glasses via an RF link. The glasses cost US$349 and the transmitter $399; both will be available in October through sales channels, Nvidia said. The company also introduced Quadro graphics cards for desktops and workstations. Quadro products fall between the GeForce line of consumer graphics cards and the Tesla line of graphics cards generally used in supercomputers.The Quadro 4000, 5000, and 6000 graphics cards are based on the new Fermi architecture and are faster than the previous generation of Quadro products. The new cards include more processing cores, operate at faster clock speeds and are able to generate more realistic images. The cards are designed for use in applications related to science, medicine, and oil and gas exploration, Fitzpatrick said.The Quadro 4000 will include 256 processing cores, while the Quadro 5000 and 6000 will include 352 and 448 processing cores, respectively. The company also introduced the QuadroPlex 7000 graphics card, which combines two Quadro 6000 graphics cards in one unit.The products will be able to harness the parallel-processing capabilities of graphics processors to improve application performance, Fitzpatrick said. That is done by native hardware support for DirectX 11, a set of parallel computing tools designed to bring realistic images on Windows 7 PCs. Nvidia also offers CUDA, a set of programming tools to develop applications for parallel task execution.The 4000 will be priced at $1,199, while the 5000 will be $2,249. They will become available worldwide starting on Aug. 2. The Quadro 6000 ($4,999) and QuadroPlex 7000 ($14,500) will become available around October.

Nvidia Unveils Tegra 3, World’s First Quad-Core Mobile Processor


By Mike Isaac11.09.1112:19 AM Edit
Follow @MikeIsaac


 wpautop enabled The Eee Pad Transformer Prime by ASUS is the first tablet to run the Tegra 3 processor. Photo courtesy of NVidia
Nvidia has unveiled its long-anticipated Tegra 3 processor, the world’s first quad-core chip designed specifically for mobile devices.
The Tegra 3 is the world’s first quad-core ARM A9-based processor, and features a 12-core GeForce graphics unit. Nvidia says the Tegra 3 offers three times the performance of its previous dual-core Tegra generation, and boasts improved multitasking, better web browsing, and smoother app performance.
The new chip will make its first appearance in the Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime — basically a higher-end version of Asus’ Eee Pad Transformer tablet, but with better cameras (8 megapixels for the back, 1.2 megapixels for the front), much more storage care of 32GB and 64GB versions, and, of course, the brawnier Tegra 3 chip.
Naturally, with such a boost in power, our thoughts turn to battery life. After all, what good is a beefier processor if you have to plug your tablet in for recharging every few hours?
Well, Nvidia and Asus promise the Tegra 3 won’t suck down power as quickly as you think. In fact, Asus says we’ll be able to watch up to 12 hours of HD video with the Prime running on the Tegra 3.
So how do they do it? It’s all about Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing, or vSMP for short. Essentially, tucked inside the Tegra 3 is a fifth “companion” processor that’s designed to kick in during times of low processing loads. The four main processors are only used when peak performance is required, such as when you’re playing games, multitasking or actively browsing through Internet pages. But when you’re simply reading a static web page, or when your tablet is otherwise sitting idle, the Tegra 3′s four primary processing cores shut off completely so your battery life won’t be sapped.
As we just shared in our coverage of leaked details concerning the HTC Edge, processor companies like Nvidia, Intel and AMD have long leveraged multi-core designs to mitigate diminishing gains in pure clock speed. So, for example, while it may be imprudent or technically infeasible to clock a mobile phone processor at, say, 2GHz for a variety of reasons, a company can roll out a multi-core chip at a much lower clock speed and still deliver faster performance (if not also improved power management, as vSMP shows us).
Mobile operating systems and apps should be coded for multiple cores to take maximum advantage of workload distribution, but once they are, they really begin to sing.
Previously referred to as code-name “Kal-El,” Rumors had pegged Amazon’s Kindle Fire to be the first to run on the Tegra 3. But, no, now we know this isn’t true.
By the end of the year, there should be about 40 games specifically tailored to leverage the Tegra 3’s processing power, with 15 available in Tegra Zone (Nvidia’s Android app that highlights Tegra-optimized applications).
Asus says the Prime is targeted at the premium end of the tablet market, with the 32GB version starting at $500, and an optional keyboard dock costing another $150. Although we haven’t yet been given a specific release date, expect to see the Transformer Prime in stores some time around the New Year.

At least for now.      by Brooke Crothers   [if lt IE 9]> <noscript><div class="datestamp"></noscript> <![endif]  April 27, 2011 9:58 PM PDT  [if lt IE 9]> <noscript></div></noscript> <![endif]    Follow @mbrookec   Bug 616807, this is to test if the Author is Chris Matyszczyk     [if lt IE 9]> <noscript></div></noscript> <![endif] 
Sony's adoption of Nvidia silicon for its upcoming Android tablets makes the graphics chip supplier--at least for the time being--the hardware standard for the Android tablet world, as a Sony vice president articulated in an interview in Japan on Wednesday. 
"For the
 tablet platform, we're standardizing on
 Android 3.0 and Nvidia's Tegra 2," said Kunimasa Suzuki, a senior vice president at Sony in an interview with Japan-based Impress Watch. 
Suzuki's comments come after Sony unveiled two Android 3.0 "Honeycomb" tablets on Tuesday. One has a 9.4-inch (1280-by-800) display and front and rear cameras, while the other is "foldable" and uses two 5.5-inch displays. Both tablets, due in the fall, will run Android 3.0 on top of Nvidia's Tegra 2 processor.

Sony's tablet, in this respect, will mimic Motorola and its Xoom tablet, which also sports Honeycomb and an Nvidia Tegra 2 processor. And others, including Toshiba, have similar Honeycomb-Nvidia tablets on the way. 
Will Strauss, president of wireless chip market research firm Forward Concepts, said that companies like Sony and Motorola are using Nvidia because of the strength of its graphics performance. "In talking to people [in the industry] that's what I'm hearing," Strauss said. 
But Google's endorsement of--and standardization on--Nvidia's Tegra technology early on before Android 3.0 was finalized for the Motorola Xoom has probably been the biggest factor in making Nvidia's chip, practically speaking, the only choice right now for Honeycomb. 
That said, Nvidia is not Intel. And this is not the PC industry where there is one dominant player. Large chip companies like Texas Instruments and Qualcomm also make processors based on the ARM architecture. Those chips can--and do--run Android. And add LG Electronics, which this week signed a new license agreement with ARM, to that list too. 
"In some cases, it's I'm Catholic and they're Catholic so let's use that," Strauss said. "Some people would prefer to use [Texas Instruments'] OMAP 4 processor because they like that graphics better," he added. 
Until that happens on a commercial Honeycomb tablet, however, Nvidia is the de-facto standard. So much so that Sony's Suzuki is aware that the adoption of Android and Nvidia threatens the perception of a "uniquely Sony" tablet, he said in the interview. 
He spelled four areas where the Japanese company intends to distinguish itself, including "optimizing" the combination of hardware and software and focusing on "networked entertainment" in which Sony tablets can communicate with a variety of consumer devices.

Nvidia is developing new CPU cores based on the Arm architecture for PCs and servers that will be able to run Microsoft's upcoming Windows OS, the company said on Wednesday.The series of CPU cores, which is code-named Denver, will be based on a future Arm architecture and give Nvidia a presence in new markets, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during a press conference at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.The announcement of new CPU cores came on the same day that Microsoft announced it is developing a future version of its Windows OS for the Arm architecture. The new Denver chips will support the upcoming Arm-based Windows OS, said Ken Brown, an Nvidia spokesman.Microsoft's Windows OS, which is used on most of the world's PCs, currently works only on x86 chipsets from companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. An Arm version of Windows could provide users an option to buy Arm-based systems as an alternative to x86 products. For many years, users had no choice on operating systems and chip architectures, said Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, in an e-mail message."Microsoft's announcement that it is bringing Windows to ultra-low power processors like Arm-based CPUs provides the final ingredient needed to enable Arm-based PCs based on Denver," Dally wrote. "Denver frees PCs, workstations and servers from the hegemony and inefficiency of the x86 architecture," Dally said. The downside is that software written for x86 chips will need to be tweaked before it can run on Arm systems.Nvidia, primarily known as a graphics card company, has hinted in the past that it was developing a CPU for PCs, but it currently offers only the Tegra 2 chip for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.The Denver CPUs will be based on future Arm processor designs, and Nvidia has licensed the Cortex-A15 processor and its successor design from Arm, Brown said. He didn't specific dates for when the CPUs will be in PCs, but he said they most likely would initially go into servers.The chips will probably combine Nvidia's graphics processor cores with Arm's CPU cores, much like the Tegra chips. The integration of CPU and GPU technology in a single, power-efficient chip will help the company better serve the PC gamer market, Brown said. Another target market for these chips is cloud computing, Nvidia officials said.During his speech, Huang was critical of the x86 architecture, which has dominated the PC market for decades. The growth of tablets and smartphones has created a "new PC industry," Huang said, which has led to an increased focus on Arm.  Arm is poised to become the new standard microprocessor architecture, and in a few years there will be more Arm processors than the number of x86 processors that "ever shipped," Huang said.He provided the example of Apple, which introduced the iPad and iPhone and has revolutionized the way PC makers build and distribute devices, Huang said. Like Apple, a lot more companies are focusing on tablets and other mobile devices."The world has changed," Huang said. "The companies in the past that were leaders are readjusting their strategies."A lot of software developers are also moving to the Arm architecture as they program for mobile devices, Huang said. With Denver, Huang hopes to attract mobile developers to write for PCs and servers.

STYLISTIC Q572



			For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. 
		



Steph Mundell
LIFEBOOK UH574



			The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint.
		



Andrew Mitsi
STYLISTIC Q702



			The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located.
		



Simon Harriott
STYLISTIC Q702



			My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

        November 18, 2013      

With CUDA 6, we’re introducing one of the most dramatic programming model improvements in the history of the CUDA platform, Unified Memory. In a typical PC or cluster node today, the memories of the CPU and GPU are physically distinct and separated by the PCI-Express bus. Before CUDA 6, that is...More

John Sailors 

A team led by Nvidia Corp. has been awarded a $25 million research grant by the Department of Defense to develop technology for the next generation of supercomputing.
The team, led by Santa Clara-based Nvidia, includes the supercomputer maker Cray Inc., Oak Ridge National Laboratory and six as-yet-unnamed universities in the United States.
The four-year research contract was awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Department's research and development arm.
The team will work to develop technology required to build future exascale supercomputers, which will be 1,000 times more-powerful than today's fastest systems.
DARPA awarded contracts to three other teams to study similar systems, with prototype systems expected by 2018.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Intel Corp. has made peace with arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., but the Federal Trade Commission's suit against the chip behemoth points to the rise of its new nemesis on the legal front -- Nvidia Corp.

                                        








The FTC complaint focuses on Intel's

 alleged anticompetive behavior against AMD in the market for central processing units, or CPUs, that run personal computers. But it also zeroed in on the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs as graphics processors are known, an arena where Nvidia                 

/quotes/zigman/80597/delayed/quotes/nls/nvda NVDA

 and Intel are locked in a bitter dispute. Read full story about FTC's suit against Intel.

Adobe, Intel highlight tech action

						Adobe paces gains in the technology sector after the company reports revenue and a forecast that exceeds expectations. Intel shares slip after the chip maker is hit with a new lawsuit. MarketWatch's Dan Gallagher reports.
					

"AMD has been neutralized, but Nvidia is loaded for bear," analyst Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said, referring to the graphics chip maker's increasing aggressive posture against the tech behemoth.









In fact, Intel general counsel Doug Melamed said in a call, "What brought us to litigation was the 11th hour addition of new issues related to graphics and benchmarks -- some of which were first mentioned to Intel as recently as December 8 and none of which was fully investigated."

                                        








David Shannon, Nvidia's general counsel, however, argued that the FTC is looking into broader issues related to Intel's behavior.

                                        








"The FTC is looking at what Intel has done in the past, but they are also looking at current competition issues," he said in a phone interview. "They are very concerned about Intel's conduct when it comes to the challenges that GPU computing brings."

                                        








In its complaint, the FTC cited Intel's conduct that it said "was and is designed to maintain Intel's monopoly" in the CPU market, and "to create a monopoly for Intel in the markets for graphics processing units."

                                        








The agency also pointed to a growing trend in the chip arena: Stand-alone graphics processors have become more sophisticated and powerful, so they are now also used to perform the functions of regular computer processors. 

                                        







An edge over Intel










It is a trend where Nvidia, as the leading maker of graphics chips, and AMD                 

/quotes/zigman/216580/delayed/quotes/nls/amd AMD
+1.77%


, which recently acquired the graphics chip powerhouse ATI Technologies, are seen as having the edge over Intel.

                                        








"GPUs are a threat to Intel's monopoly in the relevant CPU markets," the FTC complaint said. "GPUs are adding more CPU functionality with each product generation. GPU manufacturers, such as Nvidia and AMD ... are developing General Purpose GPUs and programming interfaces that threaten Intel's control over the computing platform."

                                        








The FTC also noted that Intel is struggling to keep up, saying in the complaint, "Having succeeded in slowing market adoption of competing CPUs over the past decade until it could catch up with competitors, Intel once again finds itself behind competitors in the GPU markets and related markets."

                                        








In fact, Intel last week announced that it was scrapping the rollout of a much awaited discrete graphics processor, a fumble that analysts said was an embarrassing setback for the company. See story on Intel's scrapping of graphics chip rollout.









Still, Melamed, Intel's general counsel, argued in the call that Intel "has established a record of being a vigorous competitor and innovator."

                                        








However, analyst Crawford Del Prete of International Data Corp. said he was not surprised that the FTC also focused on Nvidia, which has "been doing a great job of adding value in a space tat at one time was thought to be separate from the CPU function."

                                        








"Systems have become more integrated, and able to take advantage of GPU's in new ways, driving new kinds of functionality for new kinds of customers," he said in an e-mail interview. "By definition, it's a new competitive landscape for the CPU -- and therefore Intel."

                                        








The timing of the FTC complaint is also striking, as it comes amid a raging legal dispute between Intel and Nvidia over a licensing agreement.

                                        








Nvidia Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang himself blasted Intel in a February statement, referring to speculation that Intel is pushing to expand into new arenas as a result of the slowing growth of the PC market.

                                        








"At the heart of this issue is that the CPU has run its course and the soul of the PC is shifting quickly to the GPU," Huang argued. "This is clearly an attempt to stifle innovation to protect a decaying CPU business."

                                        








The battle flared up in public earlier this year after Intel filed a motion before a Delaware Chancery Court challenging Nvidia's right to make chipsets compatible with new Intel semiconductors that have memory controllers integrated into the main microprocessor unit. Nvidia hit back with its own suit, accusing Intel of breaching their licensing pact.

                                        








Nvidia has acknowledged recently talking to the FTC about Intel. While the company has declined to elaborate, there is much speculation that the discussions have focused on their legal tussle.

                                        








Kay said the FTC "is probably discounting the AMD settlement, figuring that it's just another way for Intel to take a hostile witness out of the game."

                                        








While Nvidia and AMD are competitors in the graphics chip market, he added, "The old Machiavellian rules would say enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, their interests are aligned, but they're not acting in concert."

                                        








In fact, Nvidia quickly issued a statement applauding the "scrutiny being placed on Intel's behavior toward GPUs, which have become an increasingly important part of the PC industry."

                                        








Meanwhile, although AMD has formally withdrawn its antitrust complaints against Intel, spokesman Michael Silverman said, "We will cooperate with any regulator, including the FTC, as legally required."

Nvidia Says First Quad-Core Chips in Tablets Coming in August



                    By Ian King & Matthew Campbell -
                  2011-02-16T00:00:00Z 









 Nvidia Corp., trying to steal ahead
of Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc., said it will sell
the first quad-core chips running computer tablets in August. 
Smartphone models based on the faster chip, the Kal-El,
will follow by the end-of-year holiday shopping season, the
company said today in a presentation at the Mobile World
Congress show in Barcelona. 
Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang is trying to
recast his company as a provider of chips for mobile devices,
lessening its reliance on graphics for personal computers. The
company is locked in a fight with Qualcomm and Texas Instruments
to bring increasingly powerful processors to the market faster. 
“It’s the only quad-core available,” said the head of
Nvidia’s mobile business Philip J. Carmack. 
In the last two weeks Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips
for phones, and Texas Instruments, said they will have quad-core
chips in devices starting next year. Building more processors
into the same piece of silicon enables the chip to better
perform multiple tasks simultaneously. 
Nvidia shares have surged 46 percent since Jan. 1 following
announcements of products based on its Tegra 2 processors. That
rise makes Nvidia the second-best performer on the Philadelphia
Semiconductor Index, which tracks the performance of 30 industry
stocks. 
On Jan. 5 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia said
that LG Electronics Inc. will use its Tegra 2 processor in its
Optimus 2X phones. Nvidia didn’t identify customers for the Kal-
El processor -- which was Superman’s name as boy -- or say
whether it will come to market as Tegra 3. 
The Santa Clara, California-based company, which reports
earnings tomorrow, fell 56 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $22.55 at 4
p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

India keen to bounce back against confident Windies in Kanpur
     Next









Reeling from a shocking defeat in the second game, world champions India will look to bounce back and assert their supremacy when they take on West Indies in the series-deciding third and final One-Day International, in Kanpur, on Wednesday.- Should Yuvraj be dropped for the third ODI against West Indies?India dominated the two-Test series and eased to victory in the first ODI but the hosts suffered a surprise two-wicket defeat in Visakhapatnam, failing to defend a competitive total under difficult conditions.West Indies will be boosted by the victory, which was their first since arriving in India, and they now will be fancying their chances of winning the final ODI and return home with the ODI series.The visitors, for the first time on this tour, will approach a match with self belief and confidence.For India, it is last international match at home before they embark on a challenging tour against South Africa and they would like to finish this series on a high.

'We want Yuvi to do well. He is someone who can bat well at No 4'
Prev     Next









India will once again depend on it's batsmen to continue their fine showing and post a huge total. The top three -- Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni -- have been the real force behind India's domination with the bat in the recent ODIs at home.With scores of 86 and 99 in the two matches played so far, Kohli, in particular, has been in scintillating form.But it is the form of Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina in the middle order which will be a cause of concern for Dhoni ahead of the series decider. The two left-handers have struggled to get going as they have been throwing their wickets away after getting starts. But Dhoni, who struck a quick-fire 51 in the last to propel India to 288, backed Yuvraj to strike form in the upcoming matches, terming the left-hander as vital cog in India's middle-order."We want Yuvi to do well. He is someone who can bat well at No 4. Someone who can really dominate the oppositions. Last few games, he has struggled a bit. At times it happens when you're under pressure the 15-20 first deliveries become crucial," Dhoni had said after the second ODI.All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who has been doing a decent job with his slow left-armers, would also be desperate to get back among the runs.

Dew hampered Indian bowlers in the second ODI
Prev     Next









Barring the last match where dew played a major factor, the Indian bowlers have been pretty consistent in the series so far.The pace trio of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Mohit Sharma leaked runs in Visakhapatnam. Dew did not help their cause as they struggled to grip the ball and handed out loose deliveries to the West Indies batsmen.The spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Jadeja, as usual, have been good with the ball in the two games and they would like to carry on their good show to help India clinch the series.Dhoni would also be hoping for an improved showing from his fielders as they dropped as many as four catches in the last match.

Bowling still remains a concern for West Indies
Prev     Next









West Indies, on the other hand, did just enough to secure the win in the second match.Kieran Powell, who has replaced injured Chris Gayle in the playing eleven, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons and Darren Sammy scored crucial half-centuries to help the Caribbean side in securing their maiden win on the tour.However, one thing which would be worrying skipper Dwayne Bravo is his batsmen's inability to convert the starts into big scores.Even though bowling still remains a concern for West Indies, their bowlers played a key role in keeping the series alive with an improved showing in the last match to restrict India to 288, who at one stage were on 194 for 3 in the 36th over, with Kohli on course for an 18th ODI century.Ravi Rampaul, Jason Holder and Sunil Narine pulled the visitors back. Narine bowled his last five overs in the last match for just eight runs, bowling two maidens while Rampaul took the wickets.

Despite Dhoni's assault towards the end, a total of 95 in the last 15 overs meant a manageable chase, which became easier as the dew got heavier.With the series-decider being a day match, toss would play a crucial role and the team winning the toss would definitely like to exploit the early morning conditions at the Green Park stadium.The two captains, however, would be cautious as they don't know what to expect from the pitch at the stadium, which is hosting an international match after nearly four years.The last time Green Park hosted an international affair was a Test match between India and Sri Lanka in November 2009 which the hosts won comfortably.Teams:India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Shami, Jaydev Unadkat, R Vinay Kumar, Ambati Rayudu, Mohit Sharma and Amit Mishra.West Indies: Dwayne Bravo (captain), Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Narsingh Deonarine, Darren Sammy, Jason Holder, Sunil Narine,Ravi Rampaul, Tino Best, Veerasammy Permaul, Kieran Powell and Denesh Ramdin.Match starts at 9am IST.

26/11: India says Pak's FIA felt evidence was more than enough
November 26, 2013 20:26 IST



In a sharp reaction to terming of the evidence given by it as a "sham" by counsel of seven Pakistani suspects in Mumbai terror attack, India on Tuesday said it was not what was communicated to it by Pakistan -- both at the political level and by its Federal Investigating Agency.
"This doesn't seem to be what has been communicated to India -both at the political level during the recent visit of Pakistan Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz and also during the meeting of Pakistan's FIA with Indian officials," official sources said in New Delhi. The sources said the FIA officials also shared the evidence available to them with their Indian counterparts and confirmed that the "breadth and expanse" of evidence was more than enough to bring to justice the perpetrators of Mumbai terror attack.
On the fifth anniversary of 26/11 on Tuesday, the sources also said New Delhi hopes that Pakistan will address its demand for an expeditious trial there of the Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed. The new lawyer of the seven Pakistani suspects charged with involvement in the incident had on Monday in Islamabad claimed that the evidence provided by India was a "sham".
"The dossiers provided by India is information and not evidence as needed by the court. The evidence provided by India is a sham," Raja Rizwan Abbasi, counsel for Lashkar-e-Tayiba commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and six other accused, told a news conference.
Responding to the Pakistani prosecution team's contention that it is satisfied with the evidence and fully confident of securing a conviction, Abbasi said, "That is what the prosecution says and this is what we feel. Only the court will decide."

Woman journo's mother files complaint against Tejpal's family memberNew Delhi: The mother of the young woman journalist, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Tarun Tejpal, today filed a complaint with the Delhi police against an immediate family member of the Tehelka Editor alleging "intimidation" over the case. Delhi police sources said the mother of the journalist came to Pandav Nagar police station in East Delhi and filed a complaint against the member of the Tejpal family. On Saturday, the victim had issued a statement saying she and her family were being subjected to pressure and intimidation at an "intensely traumatic" time to "protect" Tejpal. Police said they have forwarded the complaint to its legal department to decide how should it be handled. Yesterday, the journalist had accused Tejpal and Managing Editor Shoma Chaudhary of a "cover-up" and resorting to "tactics of intimidation, character assassination and slander". Tejpal has been charged with rape by the Goa police. A three-member Goa police team had already quizzed Chaudhury and three employees who were contacted by the victim to corroborate her version of the alleged incident. Earlier in the day, the Delhi High Court rejected Tejpal's plea for interim protection against arrest in the case. Tejpal termed the FIR as politically motivated alleging Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar was taking undue interest in the matter. In a letter to Chaudhary, the journalist, who resigned from Tehelka, yesterday said "at a time when I find myself victim to such a crime, I am shattered to find the Editor-in-Chief of Tehelka, and you - in your capacity as Managing Editor - resorting to precisely these tactics of intimidation, character assassination and slander."

Mastermind of Ponzi scam Speak Asia held in Delhi
Hindustan Times 3 hours 24 minutes ago
Three years after they cheated nearly 24 lakh investors of over Rs. 2,200 crore on the pretext of high returns, one of the three masterminds of Speak Asia scam has been arrested by the Delhi police.
		Speak Asia mastermind heldRam Sumiran Pal arrested in Delhi; hunt for two others on
Speak Asia scam: CID special team for DelhiThe team is probing the over Rs. 2,200 crore online market research scam
Rs.2,276 crore Speak Asia scam accused arrestedNew Delhi: The prime accused in the Rs.2,276 crore "Speak Asia" scam -- in which almost 24 lakh people across India were duped -- has been arrested, police said Tuesday. Ram Sumiran Pal, 37, one of the masterminds of the Speak Asia scam, was arrested Monday evening from Delhi's Connaught Place area where he had come to meet a businessman over a land deal. "Pal, who is wanted in at least eight cases in Mumbai, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, is the first senior office bearer of Speak Asia to be arrested," said Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Ravindra Yadav. The Speak Asia online survey marketing company, registered in Singapore, was introduced in India in 2010 by Pal with the help of his brother Ram Niwas Pal and Manoj Sharma. Speak Asia sold web subscriptions for Rs.11,000 and in return investors had to fill survey forms for certain multi-national firms for promised annual payment of Rs.52,000. After paying a few initial investors, Speak Asia wrapped up its operations in India around mid-2011. "During this period, the company duped over 24 lakh investors. The amount of the scam has gone up to Rs.2,276 crore," the officer said. "Both the brothers used to be part of the top management of multi-level marketing companies registered in foreign countries like Singapore, Italy and Brazil, which by its international profile, attracted more investors and also helped them in money laundering at a later stage," said Yadav. The officer said the Mumbai police's Economic Offences Wing is investigating several cases related to the Speak Asia fraud for the last two years. "It has been reported that more than 210 bank accounts containing over Rs.142 crore have been frozen. Another 150 bank accounts are reportedly under investigation over suspicion of funds being transferred in the scam," the officer said. "Speak Asia had remitted over Rs.900 crore to Singapore. The money was sent from India to banks in Singapore and from there to Dubai, Italy and Britain. Interestingly, the money came back from Britain again to the UAE (Dubai) and back to India," he said. Pal, a resident of Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, holds a master's degree in marketing management from Mumbai. His brother was also working at a multinational bank in Mumbai. After 2008, he started working with his brother and formed companies in association with other partners. They used to buy companies registered in other countries. Pal later settled in Dehradun in Uttarakhand with his in-laws. He invested the money in real estate and started construction projects of villas and luxury duplex flats in Dehradun. "Whenever he felt the heat of investigation, he used to go to Malaysia. Being aware of his wanted status, he used to take flights from Kathmandu," the officer said.

Protests in Assam over alleged rape, murder
Zee News 4 hours 34 minutes ago
Police in Assam`s Lakhimpur district are investigating the alleged rape and murder of a woman who was found with multiple injuries and who later died in a hospital, a police official said Tuesday.
		Protest over alleged rape and death of womanNORTH LAKHIMPUR, Nov 26 - The alleged rape of a young woman and her subsequent death has created a lot of sensation at Bogeenadi, 15 km east of North Lakhimpur.
Protests in Assam over alleged rape, murderGuwahati: Police in Assam's Lakhimpur district are investigating the alleged rape and murder of a woman who was found with multiple injuries and who later died in a hospital, a police official said Tuesday. People from different walks of life Tuesday launched protests demanding stern action against the culprits. Police said the incident took place Sunday. The woman was found with multiple injuries from near the Boginadi police station in the district. Although she was sent to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital for treatment, she succumbed to her injuries the same day. "It is a murder case for sure and we have started investigation to find out the culprits. However, it is difficult to say whether the woman was raped or not," said Lakhimpur Superintendent of Police P.K. Bhuyan. "We are waiting for the post-mortem report, which would confirm this," Bhuyan said. He said the probe was taking time because there was no witness and the accused are yet to be identified. A search operation is on to identify the culprits. "We could not record the statement of the victim as she was not in a position to talk when we rescued her," the police official said.

Intel and Nvidia play nice for a $1.5 billion price By Michael V. Copeland, Senior Writer January 10, 2011: 6:08 PM ET

 Intel agrees to a huge licensing deal that pays graphics powerhouse Nvidia handsomely. But, it's not exactly a thaw in their cold war.

Image via CrunchBase

After canceling a Dec. 6 trial date to hash out lawsuits they had pending against each other, chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) announced a new six-year agreement Monday. The agreement gives Intel access to the full-range of Nvidia's patents for graphics chips, which it needs to deploy its newly launched Sandy Bridge integrated graphics/CPU chip. Nvidia in turn, will receive licensing fees of $1.5 billion in five annual installments beginning January 18, and will continue to have access to Intel patents.
Just as important for Nvidia and its investors is removing the uncertainty of a legal battle with the world's largest chipmaker. It also gives Nvidia some extra cash to continue its own chip designs. "We are going to build a lot more processors and they are going to integrate a lot more graphics," Huang told Fortune. "We just thought this was a more productive way to go."
Nvidia will not have the right to the intellectual property in Intel's proprietary processors, flash memory, and certain chip sets. In other words, Nvidia won't be able to go out and make its own version of an Intel compatible  - x86 – chip, though Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang says Nvidia never intended to.
The agreement is consistent with a prior licensing deal worked out between the two companies that was set to expire in March. While time was running out on that deal, the two companies were busy lobbing lawsuits at each other claiming breaches of the agreement. All pending legal disputes have been dropped as of Monday. Seems like rather than battling it out in court, both companies would prefer to have access to each other's technology.
Why that makes sense, especially for Intel, is that until very recently, graphics chips were mostly the province of hard-core video game fans. But with HD video, video chat, and 3D rendering more and more of a selling point with consumers, the drivers of today's PC market, the graphics capability of machines has taken on greater importance. Things like encoding and decoding HD video are so-called "parallel" problems, which as it turns out, are better suited operations for graphics chips than for CPUs. If computing is placing a heavier emphasis on these kinds of parallel problems, as Huang has been claiming for the past few years, graphics processing brawn should receive more attention, and money.
Although historically Intel was about CPUs and Nvidia has been about graphics, that convergence of functions is part of the reason the two companies stopped playing nice, and why they needed to strike this deal: Intel's latest chip, dubbed Sandy Bridge, is all about its graphics capability. Intel needed a clear path to Nvidia licenses to be able to sell Sandy Bridge, which is shaping up to be a huge performance improvement over Intel's last-generation chip. Nvidia, too, needed access to Intel patents to keep pursuing its own line of processors, including Tegra2, which is being built into the latest tablets running Google's "Honeycomb" version of the Android operating system designed specfically for tablets.
And while the legal battles between Intel and Nvidia may be over, it doesn't mean these two companies are going to be strolling arm-in-arm around Silicon Valley. On the contrary, their battle in the marketplace is heating up more than ever.
At the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia announced its intention to build its own processor based on so-called ARM architecture. Microsoft (MSFT) in turn, announced that its next version of Windows would be ARM compatible. Whether that turns "Wintel" into "Winvidia" won't be known for several years when Nvidia's ARM processor is ready for the market, but the announcement did strike a psychological blow against the old order of things.
Nvidia is also battling Intel successfully on the mobile front, stealing a good chunk of the tablet business away from Intel's Atom line of so-called system-on-a-chip (SOC) with its Tegra 2 SOC, and getting into the smart-phone business ahead of Intel.

Top Enterprise Technology Companies Embrace NVIDIA GRID
Using XHTML Version of Release NVIDIA today announced that enterprises can for the first time seamlessly deliver GPU-accelerated virtual desktops and professional-graphics applications from the cloud to any device, anytime, anywhere.
        By using NVIDIA GRID™ technology, businesses are able to realize the benefits of virtualization -- security, manageability and flexibility -- while delivering the full PC experience that users expect.        Dell, HP and IBM are offering NVIDIA GRID-based servers. Citrix, Microsoft and VMware are offering NVIDIA GRID-enabled software. 
"IT departments face a growing challenge: employees increasingly bring their own devices to work, and expect mobility and a great experience," said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. "Virtualization enables them to provide secure, consistent access to company resources, but at the expense of performance and features. GRID eliminates this compromise."
At the heart of NVIDIA GRID enterprise solutions are NVIDIA GRID VGX software -- a complete stack of GPU virtualization, remoting and management libraries -- and NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2 boards, which are purpose-built for demanding server environments.
NVIDIA VGX™ software unlocks the virtualization and remoting capabilities of NVIDIA GRID GPUs and is licensed by Citrix for use in XenDesktop®, XenApp® and XenServer®; VMware for use in vSphere® and Horizon View™; and Microsoft for use in RemoteFX.
NVIDIA GRID K1 boards, which include four NVIDIA Kepler™ architecture-based GPUs and 16GB of memory, are designed to host the maximum number of concurrent users. NVIDIA GRID K2 boards, which include two higher end Kepler GPUs and 8GB of memory, are designed to serve the specific needs of users of graphics-intensive applications. 
Dell, HP and IBM announced servers with the NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2 boards, including:

Dell PowerEdge R720
            
HP ProLiant WS460c Gen8 and HP ProLiant SL250 Gen8
            
IBM iDataPlex dx360 M4 

To meet growing customer demand for certified applications, NVIDIA has launched a certification program and testing center where leading OEMs and ISV partners can validate and certify solutions. To accelerate deployment-ready validated designs, NVIDIA and Citrix are working together to establish an NVIDIA and Citrix Ready® verification program offering fast track validation to OEMs and ISVs on NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2 cards and Citrix XenDesktop solutions. 
Leading Virtualization Companies Support NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2
"Enterprises want to take advantage of the growing trends towards globalization and mobility by virtualizing desktops and applications so users can work from anywhere, anytime on any device -- while enabling the company to secure its core IP," said Bob Schultz, group vice president and general manager, Desktops and Apps at Citrix. "By leveraging NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2, combined with Citrix XenDesktop and Citrix XenApp with HDX technology, enterprises can deliver the most graphics-intensive applications to users who require rich, interactive experiences from any device."
"Windows Server 2012 introduced groundbreaking new technologies including Microsoft RemoteFX, which delivers a new level of rich graphics experiences to VDI users," said Klaas Langhout, principal program manager of Server and Tools at Microsoft. "RemoteFX and PC graphics powered by NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2 boards help enterprises serve media-rich and 3D applications on users' virtual desktops. This helps VDI users achieve interactive performance that rivals what they experience locally."
"One of the major advancements in the recent release of VMware Horizon View 5.2 is the addition of graphics acceleration for virtual desktop users," said Phil Montgomery, senior director of End User Computing at VMware. "By combining NVIDIA GRID-powered servers with VMware Horizon View, we can now deliver the rich and secure experience of Horizon View to users who require a more intensive graphics experience, such as diagnostic medical imaging and design. Graphically intense applications can be securely delivered from anywhere on any type of device, including mobile, from a controlled data center without sacrificing user experience."
Leading OEMs Support NVIDIA GRID K1 and K2
"Enabling customers to virtualize their multiple workloads is a challenge Dell is committed to, and the NVIDIA GRID technology enables our solutions to be more powerful for design and graphics-intensive applications," said Sally Stevens, vice president of Dell PowerEdge marketing.

	The last time we discussed CUDA and Tesla in depth was in September of 2010. At the time NVIDIA had just recently launched their lineup of Fermi-powered Tesla products, and was using the occasion to announce the 3.2 version of their CUDA GPGPU toolchain. And though when we’re discussing the fast pace of the GPU industry we’re normally referring to NVIDIA’s massive consumer GPU products arm, the Tesla and Quadro businesses are not to be underestimated. An aggressive 6 month refresh schedule is not just good for consumer products it seems, but it’s good for the professional side too.

	Even against the backdrop of a 6 month refresh schedule, quite a bit has changed in the intervening period. NVIDIA’s Parallel Nsight – which we only first discussed in depth back in September – has gone free, with NVIDIA realizing that charging for the software wasn’t going to sell as many GPUs and that no one likes doing software licensing. Meanwhile the first (and thusfar only) Mac Fermi card was launched in the form of a Quadro card, helping NVIDIA go after the all-important niche of Mac desktop *nix programmers. Even the financial side of things is showing some change, with NVIDIA having just closed out Fiscal Year 2011 with nearly $100mil in Tesla sales, which at around 2.8% of NVIDIA’s revenue is the highest Tesla revenue has ever been. In fact the only thing we haven’t seen surprisingly enough is a Tesla refresh – we had GF110 pegged as an obvious upgrade for the Tesla line, which under GF100 continues to ship with only 448 SPs enabled to help meet the necessary 225W power envelope.



	Meanwhile the CUDA team has been hard at work developing the next version of CUDA after CUDA 3.2, which brings us to today’s announcement. Today NVIDIA is announcing CUDA 4.0, the next full version of the toolchain. As is customary for CUDA development given its long QA cycle, NVIDIA is making their formal announcement well before the final version will be shipping. The first release candidate will be available to registered developers March 4th, and we’d expect the final version to be available a couple of months later based on NVIDIA’s previous CUDA releases.

	CUDA 4.0 ends up being an interesting release as it breaks with NVIDIA’s previous release schedules somewhat. Previous CUDA releases were timed with the launch of hardware: CUDA 1.0 was released to go with G80/G9x (albeit nearly a year after they launched), CUDA 2.0 was released for GT200 in 2008, and CUDA 3.0 was released for Fermi in 2010. In the case of CUDA 4.0 there’s no new hardware to talk about at the moment, so it’s the first independent software-only major CUDA release. I’d expect that NVIDIA will still be on CUDA 4.x by the time Kepler launches, but that’s still several months out.



	So what’s new in CUDA 4.0? As an independent software release NVIDIA’s biggest focus is on multi-GPU GPGPU performance of existing Fermi products. This is the next logical step for the company, as previous CUDA releases have continuously drilled down, starting with the basic CUDA framework which was suitable for embarrassingly parallel tasks that didn’t require intra-GPU communication, to CUDA 3.x which introduced GPUDirect thereby giving 3rd party devices direct access to CUDA memory. CUDA 4.0 in turn is the next step on that long path, and will be enabling multiple GPUs within the same system/node to more closely work together by making it easier for GPUs to access each other’s memory.

	Specifically NVIDIA is doing a few things here. On the software side NVIDIA is introducing a new unified virtual address space mode (aptly named Unified Virtual Addressing), which puts all CUDA execution – CPU and GPU – in the same address space. Prior to this each GPU and the CPU used their own virtual address space, which required a number of additional steps and careful tracking on behalf of CUDA software to copy data structures between address spaces. This would seem to be riskier on the driver side in order to keep GPUs and CPUs from stomping on each other(and hence the long QA cycle), but for CUDA developers the benefit is going to be very straightforward due to the easier memory management.



	Meanwhile on the hardware side NVIDIA is introducing GPUDirect 2.0. While GPUDirect 1.0 gave 3rd party devices direct memory access, it was primarily for network/infiniband communication purposes; GPUs within a node were still isolated in most cases, requiring data structures to be copied to system RAM first before any additional GPUs could access the data. GPUDirect 2.0 resolves this issue, introducing the ability for GPUs within a node to directly access each other’s memory without requiring a system memory copy first. And while system memory is by no means slow this is still much faster; for fully fed PCIe x16 slots this gives each GPU 8GB/sec of low latency full duplex bandwidth to use between the CPU and other GPUs. From our impressions we’d categorize GPUDirect 2.0 as being very NUMA-like (Non-Uniform Memory Access), however there’s still an important distinction between local and remote memory as PCIe bandwidth is still a fraction the speed of local memory – 8GB/sec versus 148GB/sec for a Tesla card, for example.





	The addition of UVA on the software side and GPUDirect 2.0 on the hardware side are NVIDIA’s primary tactics to improving intra-GPU performance. PCIe’s limited bandwidth means that intra-GPU communication speeds will not be approaching intra-CPU communication speeds in the near future, so SMP-like operation is still some time off, but it should be fast enough to allow developers to work on new classes of problems that were too slow without UVA/GPUDirect.

	Along with multi-GPU performance, NVIDIA is of course giving considerable focus to single/overall GPU performance. CUDA 4.0 follows up on CUDA 3.2’s additional libraries with yet another set of performance-optimized libraries. Thrust – an open source CUDA template library that mimics the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) – is being integrated into CUDA proper. Thrust has been available for a couple of years now as an external library that NVIDIA developed as a research project, and is now being promoted to a member of the CUDA family. C++ programmers used to the STL stand the most to gain, as Thrust is nearly identical and can automatically handle assigning work to GPUs or CPUs as necessary.



	CUDA C++ is also getting some further improvements by introducing some C++ features that were absent under CUDA 3.x. Virtual functions are now supported, along with the New and Delete functions for dynamic memory. NVIDIA noted that with CUDA 4.0 they’re shifting to working on developer requests, with both of these features being highly requested. We had also asked NVIDIA about what C++ adoption by developers had been like – C++ being an important part of the Fermi hardware – but unfortunately NVIDIA doesn’t have the means to precisely track which languages developers are actually using. However it sounds like adding C++ was an appropriate choice for the company.

	Finally, the last set of improvements NVIDIA is focusing on is on the developer tools themselves. Coming back again to the Mac/*nix market, NVIDIA had added CUDA debugging support to Mac OS X; *nix CUDA developers doing their development on Macs will now be able to debug their code right on their machines. Meanwhile NVIDIA’s Visual Profiler performance profiling tool is getting an upgrade of its own: previously it could identify bottlenecks in code, now it can offer hints on how to improve performance at those bottlenecks. Finally, the CUDA toolkit will now include a binary disassembler, for use in analyzing the resulting output of the CUDA compiler.

	Wrapping things up, as we mentioned before the first release candidate of CUDA 4.0 will be available to registered developers on March 4th. NVIDIA doesn’t have a commitment date for the release version, but expect it to be available a couple of months later based on NVIDIA’s previous CUDA releases.

I'm not clear what previous generations, or even current generations, or nvidia hardware CUDA 4 is supported on  (or not).Nvidia has already jerked around the audio/video production market by turning off features in their driver for the 8800 generation, even though the h/w is capable. They seem to be doing the same thing with CUDA support, abandoning older hardware before delivering on their promises.

It must be just for fermi generation.

I don't know anything about the AV issue you describe, but as a CUDA developer, I think NVIDIA has done a good job of backwards compatibility when feasible.  CUDA-capable hardware is evolving quickly, but I still have 4 year-old code which happily compiles with CUDA 3.2 and runs with the latest drivers on an 8800 GTX.  The CUDA Programmer's Guide is pretty clear about what extra features will work on each generation of card.I have no idea what the hardware requirements will be for the Unified Virtual Addressing, but I could imagine that it would require features deployed in the GT200 series, and few G90 integrated chipsets. ("zero copy support", is what I'm thinking of here)Full C++ support on the device was not promised until Fermi, so I fully expect that the addition of virtual functions and new/delete will still work on Fermi as well.From the perspective of the developer community, this is an exciting release addressing a number of highly requested features, but it's not revolutionary to the point of requiring people to go throw away all their hardware.  :)

seibert - Monday, February 28, 2011 - link
In case anyone cares: The Unified Virtual Addressing requires 64-bit addressing support on the host (so only 64-bit Linux, Windows, and Mac) and 64-bit on the GPU, which means Fermi and later.In retrospect, this seems obvious since you would blow through a 32-bit address space very easy with an average amount of host memory and two decent GPUs.

Since there are 6 GB Tesla cards now, a 32-bit address space is no longer sufficient address even a single GPU :-)

I think you're calling them out on something that is very real world inconsequential.  I have played around with CUDA and would love to work with it more, but professionally I'm not in their target market.  I can still develop with it on an older card and learn CUDA, but if I were developing software for medical imaging or searching for oil, I would have access to the highest end hardware.I think it sucks that I don't have access to the full feature set, but the people they are targeting do.  I think the consumer market would really benefit from having the kind of GP computing power (things like folding @Home), but they can't hamstring future versions of CUDA for backwards compatibility.  As the architecture matures and consumers start to actually have a market for GPGPU computing they will be more conscious of backwards compatibility.The reality is that if you bought a graphics card with CUDA 2.0 support, there wasn't a promise of CUDA 4.0 features, you hoped it might get them, but sometimes the hardware just isn't capable of supporting the features 4.0 brings to the table.TLDR version: I'm with you, it sucks, but you can't blame them IMO.

I strongly dislike nvidia for cuda. Some years ago it might have had a place but it does not today since there are tech that everyone can use available. Nvidia also shuts down their cards if you purchase an nvidia card to use it for cuda but use a card from say AMD as main card.

Not sure what your point is here - CUDA is still much further along than OpenCL in any reasonable measure (tools, libraries, etc).

raddude9 - Monday, February 28, 2011 - link
Wrong, "Openness" is a very reasonable measure, and in that respect nvidia is far behind OpenCL.

Genx87 - Monday, February 28, 2011 - link
And OpenGL is way behind DX now. Openess imo means nothing if nobody uses it.

nerdtalker: @jhoneyball it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve seen a spec table on the manufacturer website be entirely wrong
nerdtalker: @jomaKern you’re on a roll today man!
nerdtalker: @jomaKern Ha I know :P

Single threaded perf is going to suck though, all these quad A5/A7 parts seem made for China honestly
nerdtalker: @jhoneyball in retrospect, probably an error
nerdtalker: @jomaKern that said I’m eager to play with MSM8226 with quad A7 just for the heck of it
IanCutress: Stupid typos while writing #154: motehrboiard
IanCutress: @teamau But I could have had a 4K monitor by now.  Harumph, I turned on my miners again.  Less space to put them in the new flat, v. loud
IanCutress: @teamau $16, wtf.  I can't believe I sold mine at 8.4.  Rebought in at 14 and sold off at 15.9, so I've got something back.
IanCutress: HTC One max is asking to update to Kitkat.  Interesting twist in this test :)
IanCutress: @teamau It all makes me feel like someone's going to cash out big.  That jump 10->12 was too quick
anandshimpi: @tamaslnagy no not at all, sorry a bunch of things came up prior to my last trip that contributed to the delay, definitely working on both
anandshimpi: RT @anandtech: Enermax Case, Heatsink/Fan and Power Supply Giveaway: Holiday 2013 http://t.co/kr4PmKt6hn
anandshimpi: @CreatorOfMyths cost is the simple answer, I suspect it’ll happen eventually.
anandshimpi: @Sekkyo looks like that might’ve just been confused reporting initially, definitely no HDMI-CEC today.
ganeshts: @abrasion I think VLC is your problem. Try with MPC-HC or XBMC and see if the tearing persists. VLC doesn't HW accelerate all steps IIRC
ganeshts: @abrasion Shouldn't have any problems. What is the card model and software setup ? Have you tried setting the Dell res to 1080p and checked?
ganeshts: @cnetmoskovciak Not surprised. Anything addled with DRM is bound to frustrate consumers. UV still doesn't allow 'watch anywhere at any time'
ganeshts: @IanCutress Have you tried out OSFMount's RAM Disk feature? I wasn't aware that people still pay for RAM Disk sw :) http://t.co/q13EhyrSYx

								12/07/2010 10:19:32 PM PSTThe traditional holiday party is a real thing of the past at Nvidia, the Santa Clara graphics-chip giant. For the past 10 years, the company has ditched an eggnog soiree in favor of a "party with a purpose."That would be Project Inspire, a day of community service that will bring more than 400 Nvidia employees, plus at least that number of their family and friends, to San Jose's History Park on Saturday.City Year Silicon Valley has coordinated the day, during which volunteers will be building an urban garden and a greenhouse. They'll also get out the paintbrushes to spruce up History Park, which is part of Kelley Park on Senter Road, with murals and some much-needed repair to its facilities.Schmahl Science Workshops, which conducts youth science programs at History Park, will receive a $20,000 grant from Nvidia to support the urban garden, which is expected to be used by thousands of schoolchildren every year.Executive Director Belinda Schmahl said, "The garden will enhance the health of the neighborhood, and the greenhouse will become a destination where youth can improve their science skills through hands-on experiments." REMEMBERING: The parents of late author Iris Chang are expected to be among the attendees at Nanjing Ji, the annual commemoration of the Nanking Massacre in 1937 and '38, on Sunday at the San Jose Improv (62 S. Second St.).The free program, which runs from 1 to 4 p.m., includes the Voice of Harmony Artists singing Yellow River Cantata and a screening of the 2007 documentary film "Iris Chang: The Rape of Nanking."MIXING UP THE ARTS: When I ran into Nicholas Adams at the San Jose Holiday Parade on Sunday, I needled him about the holiday card he sent out because of their mailing labels, which read "Commissioner Nicholas Adams." It turns out it wasn't hubris that drove him to do so but a clever way to get people talking about the San Jose Arts Commission, which he joined this year."I did it intentionally as a conversation starter because people don't know what the arts commission is," said Adams, who added that people often confuse it with Arts Council Silicon Valley, a worthy nonprofit that supports the arts but is an entirely different group.Just so you're in the know, the arts commission is an advisory group that makes recommendations on San Jose policy on topics of art and culture. And if you run into Commissioner Adams, feel free to ask him about it.Got a tip?

Nvidia Chips to Power World’s Most Powerful Supercomputer

Oak Ridge National Lab's "Jaguar" computerIt has been about a year since the United States lost its title as the home of the world’s most powerful publicly known supercomputer. Last November, the “Jaguar” computer based at the U.S. government’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory found itself supplanted by a computer in China in the top spot on the closely watched Top 500 list of the world’s most muscular supercomputers. 
Despite the fact that the Chinese system was built largely with American-made or American-designed components, the news came as a bit of a blow to American pride, and even caught the attention of President Obama, who kvetched about it in January’s State of the Union address.
By June (the list is updated twice a year) the Chinese machine had fallen to second place, its crown seized by a supercomputer in Japan, relegating the top supercomputer in the U.S. to third place.
Today, the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, will announce plans to build a system that has a good shot at reclaiming the top spot. The machine will be named “Titan,” and its primary computing engine will be the Tesla chip from Nvidia, the company best known for turning out chips that enhance the graphics of games on personal computers.
Nvidia has been making inroads in high-performance computing for some time. Earlier this year I wrote about how the Tesla chips were helping Lucasfilm make movies faster.
I talked with Steve Scott, the CTO of Nvidia’s Tesla business unit, who told me that the Titan machine will be 10 times more powerful than the current Jaguar machine, and that 85 percent of its computing power will come from Nvidia chips, while the remaining portion will come from conventional CPU chips from Advanced Micro Devices.
Why GPUs and not CPUs? It turns out that graphics chips are really good at doing a certain kind of math known as a floating point operation, much faster than a typical CPU chip from Intel or AMD found inside a PC or server.
It’s also an issue of power. For years, as chips and the transistors on them have shrunk, the amount of power required to send pulsing through them has dropped as well. Scott says that is no longer the case. “We’ve reached the point where processors have become power constrained. If you pack all the transistors that you can onto a chip and run it as fast as you can, the chip will melt. We’ve entered a time where performance is constrained by power, and its only going to get worse, so you need processors that are power efficient,” he says. “It’s a fundamental sea change in the underlying technology of high performance computing.”
GPUs, originally designed for gaming and professional graphics applications like editing movies and visualizing complex problems for engineers and scientists, are inherently designed to perform several repetitive tasks at once. In explaining this, I always think back to the old saying “many hands make light work,” though here it’s applied to computing. Two people who divide up the task of folding a pile of laundry get it done faster than one. And four people will get it done faster than two.
Basically, a GPU chip is designed to render what happens to every pixel of a computer screen 50 times a second or even faster. Essentially, lots of small computational jobs are carried out at once. It’s called parallel computing, and, fundamentally, CPUs chips aren’t as good at it as GPU chips. CPUs are better at doing one job at a time, getting it done really fast, and then moving on to the next one. Generally speaking, Scott says, GPUs are about eight times faster at floating point operations than CPUs.
For Nvidia it will be a return trip to the top spot. China’s supercomputing champ, the Tianhe-1A at National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin, which is now ranked No. 2 in the world, uses Nvidia GPUs. This certainly got the world’s attention concerning the potential for GPUs in high performance computing.
The plan at Oak Ridge calls for Titan to have 18,000 nodes, each with an AMD CPU chip coupled with an Nvidia Tesla GPU. Most of the heavy lifting will be done by the GPUs, Scott says. Its total computing capacity will top out at 20 petaflops. FLOPS are floating point operations per second. “Peta” refers to how many the system can do every second: In this case, the answer is 20 quadrillion. Just because I can — and because it’s one of the rare cases where I get to use a number that’s larger than the national debt — I’m going to write that number out: 20,000,000,000,000,000.
And what will it be used for? While many of the Department of Energy’s computers are used to simulate nuclear explosions that are no longer allowed thanks to the Test Ban Treaty, this one won’t be. The mission at Oak Ridge, Scott says, is to advance the boundaries of science. Scientists will use it to model climate change, and to predict the results of different methods of mitigating it. They’ll also use it to design engines, study biology and genetics, and explore the possibilities of using nuclear fusion for energy. If you have interesting scientific work to do that requires this kind of computing oomph, you can even write a proposal explaining how you’d use it.
In the first phase of Titan’s deployment, which is already under way, Oak Ridge will upgrade its existing Jaguar supercomputer with 960 new Tesla chips. In a second phase, expected to start next year, Oak Ridge plans to deploy the 18,000-node Tesla-based system.
Down the road, the hope within supercomputing circles is that performance improves to the point where we’re no longer talking petaflops, but exaflops, or quintillions of floating point operations every second. The government is already working on that, and earlier this year President Obama asked Congress for $126 million in the federal budget to begin research to work on ways to get there by 2018. The biggest problem: How to supply enough electrical power while delivering the computing muscle. Today’s announcement by Oak Ridge is a big step in that direction, but there are still 981 more petaflops to conquer.

iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds
Summary: The iPad 2 is certainly more than an incremental update, but will it be enough to keep the tablet pendulum swinging in Apple's direction, at least when it comes to game development?


By Peter Cohen for Gamification |			March  4, 2011 -- 13:29 GMT (05:29 PST)

Follow @ZDNet




The iPad 2 is certainly more than an incremental update, but will it be enough to keep the tablet pendulum swinging in Apple's direction, at least when it comes to game development?

Walking into the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week, a lot of the buzz coming from mobile game developers looking for maximum performance for their titles is on Nvidia's Tegra processor architecture, which is leveraged in Motorola's Xoom tablet, the Atrix 4G smartphone and other devices that run the Android operating system.

Apple says the A5 processor that powers the iPad 2 offers up to twice the performance as the processor under the hood of the original iPad, with up to nine times better graphics performance.

But the absence of hard specs on the iPad 2 - at least for now - leaves some developers at this week's show cold. Helping advance Tegra is Nvidia's deep roots in the game development community, long championing its hardware and APIs for use by game creators.

Nvidia has also introduced a "Tegra Zone" app for mobile gamers, to find content optimized for their smartphones and tablets. That helps developers that work with Nvidia to showcase their games away from the Android Market, which is running headlong into the same signal-to-noise ratio problem that the App Store has long suffered from: a lack of meaningful ways for the developer to differentiate their products from the competition's.

Apple also still suffers from a perception among hardcore game developers that the company doesn't take their particular type of entertainment seriously. Some developers perceive casual mainstream games like Angry Birds as getting the lion's share of Apple's attention in the App Store, while more hardcore and higher-priced games often languish outside of the purview of Apple's editorial curation.

At the recent World Mobile Congress (WMC) event in Barcelona, Spain, Nvidia demonstrated a quad-core version of its Tegra architecture sporting dramatically improved performance over its current chipset. That's not available to market yet, and Tegra 2-based devices are only now slowly trickling to market. It will take some time for handset and tablet manufacturers and software developers to catch up. But the fact remains: Nvidia, like Apple, is not sitting still, and wants to compete.

There can be very little doubt that the iPad 2 will help Apple carry forward its momentum as the dominant tablet manufacturer. But just as Android-based smartphones have begun to eclipse the iPhone, Android tablets running Tegra processors and Honeycomb are likely to bite deeply into Apple's lead.

Is 2011 the year of the iPad 2, as Steve Jobs said in his presentation on Wednesday? If the feedback of game developers at GDC is any indication, it's still too soon to tell.

I know when I develop software, I never worry about how many units I might sell. I care about the technical specs of the processor I get to work with.

Peter Cohen's view is too much wishful thinking 
@zenwalker: I mean Apple paid $2 billion to developers, while others, all combined, like 20 times less. <b>This feedback for (game) developers is actual indication, and yes, 2011 will be year of iPad 2</b>.

And with the Tegra 2 completely pawned by the A5... 
The iPad 2 is looking like the gamers dream performance wise.

I think game developers are still finding their way... 
In the tablet arena. I buy plenty of games for my iPhone/iPad. I find the cheap ones very entertaining. Angry birds, it's cheap and fun, and it's fun whether you play for a few minutes at a time or hours at a time. I don't mind blowing $0.99 just to try it out. And I've bought a lot of the big name games. These are like, wow! Filled with lots of eye-candy and very engaging but the form factor really doesn't lend itself to long and engaging games. It's a great form factor for surfing the web, email or RSS feeds while watching TV in the background or a quick game during commercials. Or board games, where you can be carrying on a conversation while playing. Not so much for the intensive marathon games. It's simply not a hardcore gaming form factor. Sure they can make hardcore games for these machines, but they probably won't sell like they are hoping.

Oh well, the game makers will figure it out eventually.

@oncall writes "Filled with lots of eye-candy and very engaging but the form factor really doesn't lend itself to long and engaging games." 

You've touched on something that has been repeated at developer sessions at GDC: It's possible to make deep and meaningful gameplay for iOS and other touch devices that only lasts a couple of minutes. I think if the goal is to provide a game whose levels last for 10 or 15 minutes at a stretch, the designer isn't really thinking well about how most people use the device.

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@flargh The problem with the gaming industry is that it is stratified. There are those hard core gamers, and then there are those that just want to be amused for 10 to 15 minutes. I happen to fall in the 10 to 15 minute camp. 

If a game requires that I spend 30 minutes to get into it, then it has just lost my attention. What game developers don't get is that I am not there to get into a game. I am there to be amused for a short amount of time. No more, no less...

@oncall 

A bit off topic - but I never really found angry birds to be all that fun (I played the version with ads). It seems like a glorified version of old artillery games, with some extra physics thrown in. You don't really make any interesting choices, just velocity and angle.

I'm still trying to figure out why everybody likes angry birds so much.

I'd rather play Plants vs Zombies. A lot more choices, and a lot more variety.

Last year iOS took 82.7% of Paid Apps revenue, Android 4.7% 
fact is iOS users spend money and Android users don't.<br><br>Now with all this malware stuff in the official Google market (50-200 thousand downloads of malware laden apps) that can steal  info and activated to download more malware.  Google does not really vet the market (malware apps were caught by users not Google. Some reports say OTHER malware apps have been left there for 6 months), are people crazy enough to get droids or buy droid apps?

@Davewrite What's more, piracy is a *huge* problem in the Android marketplace - some of the developers I talk with this week indicate that piracy on some Android games is up to 90%.

Don't get me wrong - piracy still exists on iOS devices, but the rates are considerably lower.

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@Davewrite I buy my apps and with the new DRM features in honeycomb this issue won't be relevant going forward.  I use the Xoom and my wife uses the iPad, guess what, she never buys a single app and only uses free ones.  

As for app sales, those are skewed by the fact that you can buy direct from resellers with Android and you cannot with iOS. 

As for the Malware, most of the issues were on alternative installation sites but the fact that any made it into the Market Place at all says to me that Google needs to put a team together to easy the fears of the public.

Google App market Malware (200k downloads) is a disaster 
@Peter Perry <br><br>"most of the issues were on alternative installation sites"<br><br>"Most of the issues.. " well maybe<br>perhaps 50-200 thousand downloads of malware from Google is not significant when   compared to the multitudes of Android malware outside. A malware app Jakeey wallpaper has been downloaded 1 to 4 million times (Venture beat).<br><br>but trying to paint the Google App Market malware issue as not a major disaster for android is not facing the facts. Truth is as Google doesn't vet apps and it's happened in the Google market you can't trust android apps from anywhere. <br><br>As for for the Google market :<br><br>Zdnet:<br><br>".. 21 popular free apps from the market, injected root exploits into them and republished. The really scary part? 50k-200k downloads combined in 4 days.... I asked our resident hacker to take a look at the code himself, and hes verified it does indeed root the users device via rageagainstthecage or exploid. But thats just the tip of the iceberg: it does more than just yank IMEI and IMSI. Theres another APK hidden inside the code, and it steals nearly everything it can: product ID, model, partner (provider?), language, country, and userID. But thats all childs play; the true pice de rsistance is that it has the ability to download more code. In other words, theres no way to know what the app does after its installed, and the possibilities are nearly endless."<br><br>Wired:<br>"Dave Marcus, director of security research at McAfee Labs, said in an e-mail that in terms of attacks and malware, it doesnt get any worse than root access, which this malware has.<br><br>Apparently the malware apps were flagged by users, Google didn't know about it. Google practically has no vetting process. How much more malware in the Google Market? <br><br>Like I said People are crazy to buy Android devices.  I'll never feel comfortable not knowing if apps on my phone are stealing stuff or even when the app has been removed has placed malicious code in. there has been proven Android botnets which would turn your phone into a zombie, apps that look like real bank apps etc.<br><br>as for your wife not buying iPad apps, ok but that doesn't change the overall stats for money making so do developers want to chase 4.7%?

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@Davewrite I wasn't minimizing it at all, I know people who have Android Phones and you know what, most of them are unphased but with that said, neither me nor my wife have downloaded any of these apps.

And as long as Apple keeps their asshole like behavior then I say people are crazy to buy an iDevice knowing their freedoms are being controlled by a sociopath (look it up, Jobs fits this bill perfectly). 

But the reality is, this year we're going to get to watch Pwn2Own exploit the iPad and iPhone so you'll see what the King's new clothes are really made of.

I MUCH prefer Apple's way to the 
@Peter Perry 
alternative.  My history has been in computer repair and support.  So much of my time is spent dealing with issues that others have with their systems and much of that time is spent dealing with malware or applications that have to be installed, kept current and or shut off because they interfere with the install of a new application or update then turned on again after said update.  So for my personal use and to avoid taking my work home with me I choose Apple.  Am I enslaved by the walled garden or set free!?!  Depends on how you look at it I suppose to me it's very freeing and liberating to not have to concern myself with that stuff.  Is Apple fool proof or perfect clearly not but over all the odds of my having a problem are far less than in the past I had to deal with MS and now Android.  To my way of thinking Apple's way is better it just works for me where I don't have to work for it.

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@James Quinn Yeah, yeah, yeah... We get it Jim but you are either doing a little fly by night business or your infrastructure sucks because we never have these incidencts are work!  Ever, I do the systems support at my work as well and it is 100% Windows XP at this time (Windows 7 rolls out this year) and yet not a single infection.  

Maybe you don't need an Apple Product (which has been proven to be no more secure as people break into them at will during hacker conventions) but maybe your work just needs better IT People.

Anyway, after researching it more... 22 Apps were in the Marketplace but none of them actually had malware in them...  What they had was the ability to download Malware once installed. Now if you want to tell me that no apps exist right now that download content from outside of the apple app store then I'm telling you that you need to go grab any ebook reader because the concept is similar.

Yeah I know some people have not had 
@Peter Perry 
issues with Windows I get it.  I'm talking odds here.  For Windows XP there are literally thousands of pieces of malware out there and some very destructive or capable of stealing important ID information even back account numbers and passwords.  To put it this way some people never had a problem with a Yugo in fact I'd wage a years salary that there are still some perfectly running Yugos on the road in America today that never had anything but the occasional tune up needed and a worn part replaced.  Does that make the Yugo a good car?  Or at it's time a good choice?  Some huge businesses have had entire departments taken down over the years by malware.  Its a fact.  People have had their ID stolen by spyware... Another fact.  None of this that I know of has happened on a Mac.  Even if it has the numbers are so small as to not be a factor in a simple statistic calculation.  The "odds" are still in my favor by a large margin and like I said I don't need to take my work home with me.

Android is young yet.  MS did not have it's security issues until well into it's life as an industry leader.  The start on attacking Android has been much faster. The addition of crapware on Android has been much faster than it was on MS and or Windows.  Unless it is attacked much faster the end results have been seen already except it will be faster still.  I don't see Google doing anything to head this off do you?

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@James Quinn well think about this, 20,000+ Desktops in my company and I'm responsible for 1200 at my site (not including the servers I have to deal with or the phone switch that runs on a Windows Server Platform)...  That's a lot of computers to never have had any issues in the 5+ years I've been there...

Now with all that said, do you think maybe you want to put some safeguards in place at your site?  Heck, I'm going to go one step further here...  we actually have IE 6 on 90% of those computers with IE 7 approved and IE 8 testing...  

Reality is, most employees have limited access to the web, locked down computers and on several stations VB Script is actually not allowed to run...  Then on top of that we actually block a ton of sites for safety reasons and the firewall along with proxy servers and AV helps against these things.

Piracy will alway be rampant on Android. 
@Peter Perry 

By the very nature of the people that use it and its design.  Google has had to use the remote kill switch many times due to malware in their Market Place.  All you have to do is Google:

malware android -ios
malware ios -android

to see the fundamental differences between the two platforms.

Honeycomb will do nothing to address the mindset of the product using the OS.

RE: iPad 2 competes with Nvidia for game developers' hearts and minds 
@Bruizer okay now go do your own search and find the articles where is shows Google used this kill switch...  

Security experts noted these were the first pieces of malware in the official market and others were targeted select geographical locations...  

It also noted they haven't remotely removed anything as of yet because they're looking for to trace it back to the companies that were benefitting from this and they pushed a security patch to the users who downloaded the apps to prevent from working any longer.

Again, this isn't as big of an issue as Apple fans want it to be and honestly, there are security companies monitoring the App Market right now so to say nothing is being done is a pipe dream and only has a basis in Jobs Reality Distortion Field.
